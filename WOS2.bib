Abstract = {EU authorities increasingly take antitrust and data protection
   enforcement action against US internet companies. While many believe in
   digital protectionism, this article looks at the foundations of data
   protection and antitrust policies across the Atlantic to propose an
   alternative explanation based on the distinct views over how online
   markets work and should be regulated. Europeans associate data
   protection with inalienable rights, Americans treat data as an asset.
   Europeans use competition policy to advance personal freedom, US
   antitrust policy focuses on economic efficiency. These singular EU
   traits encourage the regulation of major internet companies. While the
   European mistrust of data amassing by private parties supplies political
   motivation to rein in on digital giants, its competition law framework
   provides a toolkit capable of overcoming challenges commonly present
   whenever regulators take antitrust enforcement action against Big Data
   firms. The US does not share either. This indicates that the EU/US
   divide over internet regulation will growand transatlantic tensions
   perilously increase. The article concludes by arguing for an adjusted
   role for economic reasoning in antitrust enforcement as a way to bridge
   differences.},

Abstract = {The debate surrounding `big tech' and antitrust has dominated public
   policy discourses over the past few years in many parts of the world.
   Noteworthy is that several countries and regions, including China, the
   European Union, and the United States, have launched investigations into
   the allegedly anticompetitive and exclusionary business practices of
   companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google and their Chinese
   counterparts, Alibaba and Tencent. This paper builds on the renewed
   interest in the topic and discusses in detail - and from an ordoliberal
   perspective - the key characteristics of the digital economy, the
   business conduct of tech platforms, and the corresponding antitrust
   concerns, as well as possible reform steps which could help to
   strengthen modern-day competition law and policy (and antitrust
   enforcement).},

Journal = {INDUSTRIAL AND CORPORATE CHANGE},

Abstract = {This paper gives a fresh account of competition in the digital economy.
   Economic analysis in the field of industrial organization remains
   largely focused on a sophisticated version of the Schumpeter-Arrow
   debate, which is unresolved and largely irrelevant. We posit the need to
   look at competition anew. Static models of monopoly firms and markets in
   equilibrium are often used to characterize Big Tech firms' size and
   scope. We suggest that this characterization is inappropriate because
   the growth and diversification of many digital firms lead to a situation
   of broad-spectrum competition that cuts across markets. Current market
   positions do not reflect entrenched monopoly power but are vulnerable to
   competitive pressure of disequilibrating forces arising from the use of
   data-driven operating models, astute resource orchestration, and the
   exercise of dynamic capabilities. A few strategic errors by management
   in the handling of internal transitions and/or external challenges and
   they could be competitively impaired. The implications of a more dynamic
   understanding of the competition process in the tech sector are
   explored. We consider how big data and entrepreneurial management
   impacts firm performance. We also explore the nature of different types
   of rents (Schumpeterian, Ricardian, and monopoly rents) and suggest a
   modified long-term consumer welfare standard for competition policy. We
   formulate preliminary tests and predictors to assess dynamic
   competition. Our perspective advances a policy stance that favors
   innovation.},

Title = {The Digital Markets Act and EU Competition Policy: A Critical
   Ordoliberal Evaluation},
Journal = {PHILOSOPHY OF MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {The E.U. is shortly before implementing the Digital Markets Act (DMA),
   which aims to regulate digital markets and (ideally) rein in the power
   of big tech gatekeepers. Several researchers claim that this proposal -
   and especially its goal to ensure the contestability and fairness of
   digital markets - is ordoliberal in nature, yet what is missing in the
   academic literature is a closer look at the parallels (and differences)
   between the E.U.'s competition policy (and the DMA) and ordoliberalism.
   This paper tries to close the gap and help answer the question of
   whether the DMA is indeed standing in an ordoliberal tradition.
   Furthermore, it evaluates the Act's institutional strengths and
   weaknesses - as seen from an ordoliberal perspective - and points out
   potential ways to strengthen E.U. competition policy (and the DMA) and
   bring it closer to the ordoliberal ideal.},

Abstract = {This research focuses on approaches to competition regulation of digital
   platforms, which are presented as systems with market structure and
   transaction network. The characteristic features of digital platforms
   are marked, the main instruments of obtaining and holding market power,
   forms of abuse of dominant position in the relevant market are marked.
   On the basis of a synthesis of scientific research and existing practice
   in handling antitrust cases, the principal provisions for regulating
   digital platforms are shown. It is noted that the division of digital
   platforms into transactional and nontransactional allows to determine
   the number of relevant markets that are affected by the actions of the
   platform. A number of platform digital properties have been identified
   that are important for assessing the boundaries of relevant markets.
   Special attention is paid to identifying the dominant position of the
   digital platform based on the analysis of a number of related
   conditions: consolidation of large data, the impact of network effects;
   economies of scale. The role of analysis},

Title = {Reorienting the sharing economy for social benefit: the nonprofit
   digital platform business model},
Journal = {SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {5},
Pages = {918-934},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Digital platforms enable the sharing economy and have become dominant
   business models in many industries. Despite their many benefits,
   negative externalities associated with the growth of for-profit digital
   platforms, such as Uber and Google, have ignited concerns among market
   participants, policymakers and society as a whole, without corrective
   market forces in sight. One way to address this problem is through a
   combination of government regulation, criminal enforcement actions and
   private antitrust litigation. This study aims to analyze an alternative
   approach, called the nonprofit digital platform (NDP), which is an
   emerging business model capable of unleashing free-market forces and
   enhancing the sharing economy's social benefits.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study documents the negative externalities (actual and potential)
   of for-profit digital platforms, uses the product attributes model to
   explain the market position and strategy of NDPs with respect to
   for-profit digital platforms and provides recommendations for the
   successful launch and management of NDPs.
   Findings
   An NDP is a market-based alternative to antitrust, regulation and
   litigation that enhances the social value created by the sharing
   economy, but its success requires startup-like management that attracts
   and retains talent, capital, effective advertising and positive network
   externalities.
   Social implications
   NDPs can force free-market adjustments in the industries they enter,
   reduce the negative spillovers of for-profit digital platforms and
   increase social value by incrementally raising the level of competition.
   Originality/value
   This study conceptually explores the value that nonprofits could bring
   to the sharing economy in fulfilling its promise and provides strategic
   recommendations for social-digital entrepreneurs and nonprofits.},

Abstract = {The populist use of competition policies is on the rise again,
   associated with the growth of big-tech companies in the era of digital
   platforms. This article sees antitrust populism as a re-emerging force
   in the United States and Europe via greater politicisation of
   competition law enforcement. It addresses the basic tenets of antitrust
   populism in order to expose the fundamental problems that populist use
   of competition law entails. I argue for a rethink of antitrust policy on
   the intellectual foundations laid down by what Mark Pennington describes
   as `robust political economy'. We need greater regulatory humility and
   antitrust enforcement which takes both innovation and welfare seriously.},

   platform industry, particularly those that have been frequently affected
   by recent antitrust events. I then provide a brief overview of economic
   theories that are often cited in think tank reports and official
   documents, including network externalities, hub-and-spoke collusion, and
   contestable markets. Finally, recent platform antitrust events in China
   are reviewed, including the introduction of platform antitrust
   guidelines and major antitrust cases.},

Abstract = {Digital platforms elude legal and regulatory frameworks traditionally
   used to address market power, speech and disinformation issues. One of
   the dominant policy responses to addressing these issues involves
   reforming competition policy to better manage digital platform markets.
   This case study examines how stakeholders, including tech giants, their
   competitors, regulators and advocacy groups, deploy competition policy
   to address platform power in a series of 2019-20 US congressional
   hearings on the subject, with implications for the wider global debate.
   The article traces the politics underlying these debates, which
   manifests in variations in stakeholders' definitions of platform power
   and their proposed solutions, reflecting tensions over the role of the
   state in managing markets and in addressing non-economic concerns
   associated with digital platforms. The article concludes with a
   consideration of what this politics implies for policy interventions
   aimed at addressing platform power.},

Abstract = {Economic reality has dramatically changed in the 21st century.
   Competition and monopoly behaviour are under radical transformation due
   to digital effects in contemporary business world. Digitalization has
   engendered many new types of monopolistic conduct and deeply altered
   traditional forms of firms' misconduct. In a digital era, the antitrust
   policy should rethink its concepts of regulation, market power, and
   anticompetitive behaviour. The analysis of contemporary competition
   policy in different countries shows that traditional antitrust rules
   could not effectively deal with digital activity. Having entered even in
   an ordinary space of anticompetitive firm behaviour, digital world has
   challenged traditional concepts of antitrust policy. The antitrust rules
   that dominated in the 20th century are mostly outdated when applied to
   digital era trends. What should and could competition policy do to meet
   the requirements of the 21st century? The article touches upon
   contemporary foreign investigations in the sphere of competition and
   competition policy. Our analysis demonstrates the challenges that are
   under way in antitrust regulation. Special attention is paid on new
   patterns that characterize traditional forms of monopolistic behaviour
   (cartels, dominant misconduct, predatory pricing, exclusive dealing,
   etc.) in a digital world. There was drawn the conclusion concerning the
   vital necessity of a cardinal transformation for the antitrust policy
   from a hard state controller into a flexible business consultant, with
   the aim not to punish but to prevent market misconduct.},

Abstract = {Data collection and processing are at the core of rapidly growing
   business models, underpinning the activities of technology companies and
   acting as a source of market power. The key role played by data in the
   competitive dynamics of digital ecosystems has brought competition
   policy and data protection regulation closer together and raised
   important questions about the substantive relationship between these two
   branches of law. After identifying the specific ways in which data
   create and power digital ecosystems and examining the effects of digital
   privacy (or lack thereof) on consumer welfare, we compare the legal
   obligations imposed by competition policy and data protection
   regulation. We then map the interfaces between these two branches of law
   and critically assess the areas of substantive overlap between them. We
   show that while in the majority of situations there is an alignment of
   these two frameworks, opposite outcomes can sometimes be reached when
   competition and data protection rules are applied separately. We suggest
   that these two legal instruments should be considered as overlapping
   areas in a regulatory continuum to facilitate positive synergies and
   neutralize potential conflicts. We show that there is a significant
   scope for competition policy actors and institutions to substantially
   incorporate data protection considerations into their decisional
   practice and that this integration can inform and enhance the
   enforcement of competition law. We propose an integrated approach to
   more effectively regulate digital platform ecosystems, to support
   innovation, and to protect consumers and the competitive process.},

   law},
Journal = {COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Antitrust enforcement and competition policy in the digital economy is
   high on the agenda of authorities and policymakers. The distinctive
   features of digital markets and the strategic role played by large
   platforms apparently require a rethinking of the antitrust regime.
   Several reform proposals point to the need to integrate the antitrust
   toolkit with ex ante measures since there is a risk that ex post
   enforcement would be too slow to successfully keep markets competitive
   and contestable. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the
   invoked regulatory approach reflects the distinctive structural features
   of digital markets or whether it is just an enforcement short-cut.},

Abstract = {We propose an analysis of platform competition based on the academic
   literature with a view towards competition policy. First, we discuss to
   which extent competition can emerge in digital markets and show which
   forms it can take. In particular, we underline the role of dynamics, but
   also of platform differentiation, consumers multi-homing and beliefs to
   allow competition in platform markets. Second, we analyze competition
   policy issues and discuss how rules designed for standard markets can
   perform in two-sided markets. We show that multi-sided externalities
   create new opportunities for anti-competitive conducts, often related to
   pricing and contractual imperfections. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Anti-competitive notions, it seems, are increasingly informing the
   critical debate on a data-driven economy organised into scalable digital
   platforms. Issues of market definitions, how to value personal data on
   multisided platforms, and how to detect and regulate misuses of dominant
   positions have become key nomenclature on the battlefield of addressing
   fairness in our contemporary digital societies. This article looks at
   the central themes for this special issue on governing trust in European
   platform societies through the lens of contemporary developments in the
   field of competition law. Three main questions are addressed: (1) To
   what extent are the platforms' own abilities to govern their
   infrastructures, that is, to be de facto regulators over both human
   behaviour and market circumstances, a challenge for contemporary
   competition regulation? (2) In what way is the collection, aggregation,
   or handling of consumers' data of relevance for competition? (3) How can
   the particular European challenges of governing US-based digital
   platforms more broadly be understood in terms of the relationship
   between transparency and public trust? Of particular relevance - and
   challenge - here are the platforms' abilities to govern their
   infrastructures, albeit through automated moderation, pricing or
   scalable data handling. It is argued that this aspect of coded, and
   possibly autonomously adapting, intra-platform governance, poses
   significant anti-competitive challenges for supervisory authorities,
   with possible negative implications for consumer autonomy and wellbeing
   as well as platform-dependent other companies.},

Abstract = {Digital platforms have been well recognized by consumers in terms of
   their benefits mainly because platforms make information more accessible
   and communication easier, create new business opportunities and increase
   choice of products and services. Their development has facilitated
   people's lives in various ways, from shopping to social interaction.
   However, digital platforms significantly control consumer data and from
   competition law perspective, they have gained significant market power
   to the extent that many of them are raising concerns not only about
   competition but also about consumer protection and privacy. That is why
   many countries are studying the negative effects of the market power of
   these platforms and are exploring ways to deal with the related
   challenges. Against such background, the first part of the paper brings
   to the fore the specific features of digital platforms, the changes they
   have brought to the global business landscape and the competition
   concerns arising from big technology. In the second part, the focus is
   on the analysis of economy platform implications for competition law and
   policy and its enforcers. In the third part of the paper, the adequacy
   of current competition policy tools to deal with the challenges arising
   from digitization is assessed by examining a series of cases handled by
   European Commission in the digital area. In the end, some concluding
   remarks will follow.},

Title = {SHOULD ASEAN ANTITRUST LAWS EMULATE EUROPEAN COMPETITION POLICY?},
Journal = {SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
   (ASEAN) members embark upon various initiatives that seek to harmonize
   their competition regimes. These ongoing efforts to modernize and
   harmonize ASEAN competition laws take place amid a longstanding effort
   by both the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) to export
   their respective competition laws throughout the world. This raises a
   critical question: should the ASEAN countries attempt to mimic the
   competition regimes of other developed nations, notably those that are
   in force in the EU and the US? And, if so, which one of these regimes
   should they draw more inspiration from? This paper seeks to dispel the
   myth that the European model of competition enforcement would
   necessarily provide a superior blueprint. To the contrary, it shows that
   the evolutionary, common-law-like regime that has emerged in the US has
   many strengths that are often overlooked by contemporary competition
   policy scholarship, and which might provide a particularly good fit for
   the economic and political realities of the ASEAN member states. The
   paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 analyzes the high-level differences
   between the American and European approaches to competition policy.
   Section 3 shows that the US and Europe also differ substantially in
   terms of the conduct that may constitute an infringement of competition
   law - the EU system being significantly more restrictive. Section 4
   turns to the thorny problem of digital platforms, in particular, and
   argues that while the European model might more readily facilitate
   intervention against digital platforms, the resulting cases may be
   detrimental to consumers and the economy more broadly. Section 5 posits
   that reducing economic concentration - sometimes cited as a byproduct of
   European-style competition enforcement - should not be a self-standing
   goal of antitrust policy. Finally, Section 6 argues that many of the
   economic and political characteristics of the ASEAN economy cut in favor
   of using the US model of competition enforcement as a blueprint for
   further development and harmonization of ASEAN competition law.},

Abstract = {Online platforms increasingly offer consumers services `for free', in
   exchange for collecting consumers' personal data. This business model is
   highly successful, leading some online platforms to gain substantial
   market power. This market power can cause consumer harm-not through
   higher prices, but in the form of privacy harm. This article considers
   what role competition law and data protection law can play in mitigating
   this harm to privacy. The article considers how we can conceptualize
   exploitative abuse of dominance cases in zero-price markets. The article
   calls into question if data protection laws should play a role in
   antitrust abuse assessments, against the background of the
   Bundeskartellamt antitrust investigation into Facebook's data collection
   practices. The article argues that, even in digital markets that
   unequivocally link market power with data privacy concerns, competition
   law and data protection law have complementary but distinct roles to
   play.},

Abstract = {The world of electronic commerce has revolutionized retailing and
   marketing. Electronic commerce has not only created a new marketplace
   bur also greatly reduced traditional market borders and increased the
   opportunities for competition. In this article, the author addresses how
   electronic commerce has changed the competitive retailing marketplace
   and how antitrust enforcers face the challenge of ensuring that
   competition is not stifled in these new markers. He discusses the
   application of traditional antitrust analysis to the new competitive
   issues in electronic commerce.},

Abstract = {This article presents some basic principles for conducting the antitrust
   analysis of multisided platforms that courts could adapt to the
   particulars of their jurisdictions and case laws. It has a particular
   focus on measuring consumer surplus for platform businesses and the
   implications of that for the design of antitrust rules. It shows how
   multisided platforms increase welfare by reducing transactions costs and
   resolving externalities among economic agents. It presents three
   normative principles for policy interventions and illustrates these
   principles by showing how they apply to recent debates over privacy. The
   article then develops a framework for considering antitrust rules in
   light of these principles given the objectives of antitrust law, error
   costs, and developing administrable rules. It lastly considers the
   competing approaches to analysing multisided platforms that were
   presented to the Supreme Court in the American Express litigation and
   the Court's decision in light of these principles.},

Abstract = {Commentators on both the right and the left ends of the political
   spectrum have called for new and more forceful approaches to antitrust
   enforcement with respect to large multisided platforms: especially
   Amazon, Facebook, and Google. In part, these calls have been driven by
   the fact that these platforms have business models that make extensive
   use of data about their users. This article surveys what economics has
   to say about a wide range of antitrust issuesincluding the treatment of
   exclusionary conduct, merger, and privacythat are raised by multisided
   platforms' reliance on big data collected about their users.},

Title = {Big Tech mergers: Innovation, competition for the market, and the
   acquisition of emerging competitors},
Journal = {INFORMATION ECONOMICS AND POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {54},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There is broad concern that merger policy toward Big Tech has been too
   lenient. Big Tech typically operates in markets characterized by
   innovation-driven ``competition for the market.{''} I show that this
   fact provides a rationale for heightened scrutiny of incumbents'
   acquisitions of emerging or potential competitors. I also address the
   widespread argument that permissive merger policy promotes innovative
   entry by facilitating entry for buyout. I show that permissive merger
   policy can also discourage entrant innovation. One way is by diminishing
   entrants' incentives to invest in marginal product improvements when
   such improvements reduce the gains from merger. A second way is by
   facilitating incumbency for buyout, under which an incumbent makes
   investments in order to extract rents from an entrant through merger.

Title = {Boundedly Rational Users and the Fable of Break-Ups: Why Breaking-Up Big
   Tech Companies Probably Will Not Promote Competition from Behavioural
   Economics Perspective},
Journal = {WORLD COMPETITION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {The aim of this short article is to show why breaking-up big tech
   companies, probably will not promote competition from `behavioural
   economics' standpoint. In particular, this article shows that `bounded
   rationality' theory casts heavy doubt on the ability of breaking-up
   large tech companies to effectively promote competition in digital
   markets. As recent behavioural evidence shows, users tend to use only
   one single platform, instead of using multiple platforms in such way
   that will promote competition between these platforms. It also shows
   that users do not always choose the best quality platforms available to
   them among others. In light of this evidence, it is not likely that
   competition will emerge in digital markets after the breakup, as it is
   expected that users, which can be regarded as `boundedly rational
   users', will probably still behave in such a manner that deviates from
   strict patterns of rationality, and continue to use only one single
   platform. As a result, and after the breakup, digital markets will
   continue to be dominated by a single platform. Hence, this article
   concludes that the notion of breaking-up big tech companies should be
   abandoned entirely, and other solutions for curbing big tech companies'
   economic power should be sought instead.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that a paradigmatic change in competition policy is
   needed and empirically under way to cope with the challenges posed by
   economically strong online platforms and their big-data-based business
   models. Competition policy needs to move further away from its
   traditional price-oriented emphasis and increasingly focus on non-price
   competition, on attention markets and zero prices, and on big user data,
   which has become a new asset class in digital economies.},

Abstract = {The goal of this article is to study the effects of legal protection of
   personal data (privacy) on competition, and to investigate to which
   extent privacy is complementary or opposed to antitrust policy. First,
   we highlight the role of the costs faced by consumers due to privacy
   regulation, including the consent costs occuring when consumers want to
   use an online service. Second, we extend Campbell, Goldfarb et Tucker
   (2015]'s model on the advertising-supported Internet by introducing
   different consent costs. We show that, in some cases, firms may prefer
   to exclude high-consent consumers from the market, so as to target the
   remaining consumers.},

Abstract = {Innovation is fundamental to economic growth, competition, and consumer
   welfare. It involves five core elements: Creativity, risk-taking,
   value-addition, adoption, and destruction. When these elements are
   combined, they produce powerful new technologies that revolutionize the
   way we work, travel, interact and more. Politicians, regulators, and
   consumers are asking whether antitrust can adequately promote and
   protect competition and innovation in the digital sector. Can it ensure
   access to competitively important data? Can it prevent mergers that
   eliminate future rivals? And can it address foreclosure by incumbent
   service providers? This article argues that the solution does not lie in
   overly broad changes to legal duties, burdens and standards of proof,
   which could have adverse consequences. Instead, governments, agencies,
   and industry should cooperate to produce rules that promote innovation
   by digital platforms and new entrants alike. This model of participative
   antitrust offers a promising path forward.},

Abstract = {In the light of several ongoing antitrust investigations in the E.U. and
   the U.S., the following research paper analyzes whether `big tech' -
   same as the big banks - need special regulatory (and economic
   -political) attention and if so, how an updated form of regulatory
   policy for the digital era could look like. It does so by utilizing -
   and reviving - the normative and business -ethical ideals of German
   `neoliberalism', also known as (classical) ordoliberalism. Especially,
   Walter Eucken's work has the potential to inform and enrich the current
   debate concerning the regulation of big tech. The main goal of the paper
   is to outline a potentially new regulatory framework - one that combines
   (and revises) Eucken's ordoliberalism with the competition policy of the
   European Union.},

Abstract = {The emergence of the multi-sided platform business model has had a
   profound impact on the news publishing industry. By acting as
   gatekeepers to news traffic, large online platforms appear to be
   unavoidable trading partners for news businesses and may exert
   substantial bargaining power in their dealings. Concerns have been
   raised that this bargaining power imbalance may threaten the viability
   of publishers' businesses. Notably, digital infomediaries are accused of
   capturing a huge share of the advertising revenue by free-riding on the
   investments made in producing news content. Moreover, by affecting the
   monetization of news, the dominance of some online platforms is deemed
   to have contributed to the decline of trustworthy sources of news.
   Against this background, governments have been urged to intervene in
   order to ensure the sustainability of the publishing industry. The EU
   has decided to address publishers' concerns by introducing an additional
   layer of copyright as a means to encourage cooperation between press
   publishers and online services. And the French Competition Authority has
   recently accused Google of adopting a display policy aimed at
   frustrating the objective of the domestic law implementing the EU
   legislation, hence requiring Google to conduct negotiations in good
   faith with publishers and news agencies on the remuneration for the
   reuse of their protected content. The Australian Competition and
   Consumer Commission has instead embraced a regulatory approach,
   developing a mandatory bargaining code. The aim of this article is to
   analyse the different solutions advanced in order to assess their
   economic and legal justifications as well as their effectiveness.},

Abstract = {We analyze platform competition where user data is collected to improve
   ad-targeting. Considering that users incur privacy costs, we show that
   the equilibrium level of data provision is distorted and can be
   inefficiently high or low: if overall competition is weak or if
   targeting benefits are low, too much private data is collected, and
   vice-versa. Further, we find that softer competition on either market
   side leads to more data collection, which implies substitutability
   between competition policy measures on both market sides. Moreover, if
   platforms engage in two-sided pricing, data provision is efficient. (c)

   remedy market failures concerning privacy rights and privacy preferences

   developed. The new economics of privacy helps explain the complex
   trade-off problems between benefits and the costs of privacy and

Abstract = {The debate on how to promote competition vis-a-vis the exclusivity of
   patent law has acquired new accents with the necessity to have access to
   standard essential patents for the Internet of Things. Patent ambush or
   patent thickets may be obstacles to more connectivity in sectors such as
   automated driving. Yet, the Court of Justice raised the bar for
   intervention in the Huawei case on compulsory licenses as a defence
   against patent violation claims. The European Commission, in its quest
   to enable the Internet of Things, has therefore turned away from
   enforcement of the abuse of dominance provisions in patent cases by
   proposing other tools in its 2017 communication on standard essential
   patents. The proposals - more transparency for licensing, more open
   source - may be read as preparation for regulation. The proposals have
   deficits, too. To remedy the problem, the Commission most probably will
   introduce sectoral regulation. It may be more fruitful to pursue a
   competition-oriented path by: (a) a competition-law control of IoT
   platforms, (b) an innovation-oriented merger policy as started with
   Dow/Dupont, and (c) the use of interim measures in the specific IoT
   context according to Art. 8 of Regulation 1/2003 with presumptions of
   dominance and abuse.},

Abstract = {A significant increase in regulatory activities throughout the world
   requires the development of a harmonized legal framework with the aim of
   protecting consumer rights, increasing the transparency of
   entrepreneurs, maintaining healthy competition, and protecting
   confidential information. The paper presents the author's view on the
   model of legal regulation of digital platforms in Russia. The five
   structural elements of the system of Russian legislation that are to be
   fixed in the rules of law are indicated. The authors have developed
   three theories of the features of the functioning of digital platforms,
   i.e. the theory of control and data management, the theory of the
   gratuitousness of the services of digital platforms, and the theory of
   competition of digital platforms, which should be put into the antitrust
   doctrine. It is confirmed that some countries have begun lawmaking
   activities to improve legislation but only in some areas. The conclusion
   is drawn on the formation of a single concept of legal regulation of
   digital platforms in Russia.},

Title = {Antitrust and Innovation Competition},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT},
Abstract = {Innovation competition presents challenges for antitrust law and
   enforcement policy. Innovation has generated changes in the nature of
   competition as firms introduce new transaction techniques, product
   designs, and production processes. Innovation competition is driving the
   `Business Revolution' in retail, wholesale, manufacturing, services, and
   financial technology. Transaction innovation in online platforms and
   multi-sided markets has raised antitrust concerns about anticompetitive
   conduct, vertical restraints, consumer privacy, and barriers to
   entrepreneurship. The article argues that although antitrust policy
   makers recognize the importance of innovation competition, they need to
   update their economic frameworks. Antitrust policy makers need to move
   beyond traditional analysis based on the twin frameworks of perfect
   competition and imperfect competition. The article provides an
   introduction to the emerging Economics of Technology \& Innovation and
   examines some implications for antitrust policy. First, antitrust policy
   should shift its focus from price competition without technological
   change to address non-price aspects of innovation competition. Secondly,
   antitrust policy should apply economic analysis that recognizes the
   critical role of Intellectual Property and technology standards in
   innovation competition. Thirdly, antitrust policy toward horizontal and
   vertical mergers should consider developments in the economic analysis
   of innovation competition.},

Journal = {IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS},
Year = {2022},
Number = {36},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This article analyses the competitive dynamic between Facebook, Google,
   and online journalistic media. On the one hand, news editors and digital
   platforms complement each other. Editors publish their con-tent on
   platforms, helping them to attract new users. In return, the platforms
   generate web traffic to the editors' websites. However, this
   relationship does not result in mutual benefit. While the platforms
   exploit journalistic content protected by copyright law without
   remuneration, they also control traffic to the editors, who depend on
   the platforms to reach their audience.On the other hand, editors and
   platforms are competing in the digital advertising market for users'
   attention and advertiser spending. The competitive advantage of data
   enables the platforms to seg-ment their audiences more effectively for
   advertising to reach them. As a result, advertiser spending is
   concentrated on the Facebook-Google duopoly. For their part,
   journalistic channels experience a decrease in advertiser spending,
   which threatens their financial viability.To balance this asymmetry, US
   legislators have presented a project entitled the Journalism
   Compe-tition and Preservation Act (JCPA). The law will enable
   journalistic editors to negotiate collectively with digital platforms to
   receive remuneration for the use of their content. There are two
   regulatory antecedents to this project. France was the first country to
   translate EU legislation on copyright law for use in that country.
   Australia sanctioned an obligatory collective negotiation code for
   determining the remuneration received for journalistic content
   distributed online.This article compares the three types of legislation
   along with their effects on the relationships be-tween journalistic
   editors, Facebook, and Google.},

Abstract = {While price-fixing on platforms can attract severe enforcement action,
   as shown by the Amazon poster case, a more nuanced picture emerges
   regarding the fixing of prices for sellers by sharing economy platforms.
   This article explores possible antitrust responses to such centralized
   platform-driven price-fixing. The article, first, provides an
   introduction to the sharing economy and pricing models on such
   platforms. Then, it investigates the extent to which established case
   law and frameworks applied in competition law fit with the incentive
   structure and the operation of such platforms. In the final section, the
   article highlights key questions from a competition law and from a
   policy perspective. It shows how such practices defy traditional
   antitrust thinking and give rise to new policy and legal challenges.},

Abstract = {The emergence of large technology platforms has raised fundamental
   questions about antitrust enforcement. These questions, which are the
   subject of this RIO special issue, are now challenging scholars and
   policy makers. The topics covered here include the role of economics and
   the consumer welfare standard in antitrust; lessons from historic
   antitrust cases; the role of big data in antitrust analysis; antitrust
   analysis of multi-sided markets; and the interplay between competition
   and privacy regulation.},

Title = {Platform-Based Business Models and Financial Inclusion: Policy
   Trade-Offs and Approaches(1)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW \& ECONOMICS},
Abstract = {Three types of digital platforms are expanding in financial services:
   (i) fintech entrants; (ii) big tech firms; and (iii) increasingly,
   incumbent financial institutions with platform-based business models.
   These platforms can dramatically lower costs and thereby aid financial
   inclusion-but these same features can give rise to digital monopolies
   and oligopolies. Digital platforms operate in multisided markets and
   rely crucially on big data. This leads to specific network effects,
   returns to scale and scope, and policy trade-offs. To reap the benefits
   of platforms while mitigating risks, policy makers can: (i) apply
   existing financial, antitrust and privacy regulations, (ii) adapt old
   and adopt new regulations, combining an activity and entity-based
   approach, and/or (iii) provide new public infrastructures, such as
   digital identity and retail fast payment systems. These public
   infrastructures, as well as ex ante competition rules and data
   portability, are particularly promising. Yet to achieve their policy
   goals, central banks and financial regulators need to coordinate with
   competition and data protection authorities.},

Abstract = {The digital based `sharing economy' business pattern is causing a major
   shift in business trends in ASEAN nations. This shift has disrupted the
   conventional market business practices and competition on many aspects
   for goods or services. The current legal phenomenon has provoked the
   application of competition law and the regulating authority as to how to
   interact with this new frontier business platform in Malaysia and
   Indonesia which is still new to competition law. Therefore, the issue is
   how to promote creative technology and regulate the sharing economy in
   market competition? This paper studies the impacts of the sharing
   economy on conventional business and consumer market competition to
   critically assess its interaction within the scope of national
   competition law regime specifically in Malaysia and Indonesia.
   Comparative legal method will be the core research method adopted
   alongside socio-legal analysis to substantiate the validity of the
   hypothesis. This paper proposes that law and regulating authorities must
   introduce some regulatory measures to balance between aspects of
   anti-competitive protection rules and incentives for innovation in
   sharing economy business on issues such as standardization-related
   abuses, imposition of abusive terms in licensing, refusal to license or
   deal, disruptive innovations and mergers. The paper proposes
   recommendations with respect to public policy justification and/or
   exemptions to adapt and facilitate the changes brought about by the
   innovative new creative technologies in Malaysia and Indonesia in the
   interplay of competition policy and digital economy. (C) 2017 Published

Abstract = {The twenty-first century global economy is largely driven by Big Tech
   and, more broadly, digital capitalism. This is a global phenomenon, with
   US power at the centre preying on global markets through the process of
   digital colonialism. Mainstream antidotes to the ills of Big Tech and
   digital capitalism are US/Eurocentric and revolve around a collection of
   liberal and progressive capitalist reforms, including anti-trust,
   limited privacy laws, unionisation of Big Tech, algorithmic
   discrimination and content moderation - all of which are conceived
   within a capitalist framework which ignores or neglects digital
   colonialism and the twenty-first century ecological crisis, despite
   their analytical and moral centrality to contemporary political economy.
   This author argues that a combination of political, economic and social
   alternatives based on a Digital Tech Deal are needed to turn the tide
   against digital colonisation, entailing the socialisation of knowledge
   and infrastructure; passing socialist laws that support digital
   socialism; and new narratives about the tech ecosystem. These solutions
   are to be nested within an anti-colonial, eco-socialist framework that
   embraces degrowth to ensure environmental sustainability and
   socioeconomic justice.},

Abstract = {Although the economics of multisided platforms has developed important
   insights for antitrust policy, there are critical respects in which the
   body of academic knowledge falls short of providing useful advice to
   enforcement agencies and the courts. Indeed, there is a substantial risk
   that recent scholarship will be misapplied to the detriment of sound
   antitrust policy, as evidenced by the US Supreme Court's recent decision
   in American Express. In this note, I identify several areas in which
   economics research could potentially make significant contributions to
   the practical antitrust treatment of platforms.},

Abstract = {EU digital competition policy is in the process of a paradigmatic
   transformation. The main legal instrument, epitomising the rationale of
   the reform is the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA). This article
   conceptualises the broader theoretical foundations of EU digital
   competition policy and law, illustrating the developed hypotheses by
   examining the selected procedural novelties of the DMA. The main
   normative proposition, underpinning this article is that the emerging
   more proactive approach to digital markets reflects an objective
   socio-economic and political trend. This implies that the purified,
   inwards-oriented perception of competition policy will be gradually
   converting towards a more polycentric modality. An earlier version of
   this article has been awarded the prize by the Portuguese Competition
   Authority 2021 ``Competition Policy Award for academic work in
   Competition Policy{''}.(c) 2022 Oles Andriychuk. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {The American multinational company Google is one of the most important
   businesses in the new economy, thanks to its innovation has positioned
   itself as a leader in the Internet environment worldwide. One of its
   main products is Google Search, which has been in the public eye,
   because authorities in antitrust considered that search machine
   infringes the antitrust legal system. The company Google has faced
   indictments for this reason countries like the US and the EU, but in
   both cases it is considered that the authorities responsible for
   research has not given clear and sound criteria to determine the guilt
   or innocence of the digital enterprise, based on the actual behavior of
   competition in the markets for electronic commerce, which belong to the
   new Economy, so this article presents a brief description of both cases
   and proposals of the key aspects that investigations by the authorities
   in the field should take.},

Title = {Digital monopolies: Privacy protection or price regulation?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Increasing returns to scale in data gathering and processing give rise
   to a new form of monopoly, referred to here as digital monopoly. Digital
   monopolies create new challenges for regulators and antitrust
   authorities. We address two in this paper: market power arising from
   improved match values and from reduced privacy. The digital monopoly's
   profit and social surplus always increase as privacy decreases. However,
   consumer surplus is non-monotone in privacy. Without privacy, the match
   value is perfect but completely extracted by the digital monopoly. In
   contrast, as privacy goes to infinity, match values and social surplus
   go to zero. With regulated prices, consumer surplus is maximized without
   privacy protection. As with natural monopolies, price regulation thus
   remains an appropriate tool in the digital age to capture the social
   benefits from increasing returns to scale without harming consumers. (C)

Abstract = {Digital transformation is a source of new and changed business models
   that change market conditions. Digital platforms facilitate access to
   global market for enterprises of all sizes. However, taking a dominant
   position in the market and abusing the market power of digital platforms
   are common forms of distortion of competition. The aim of this paper is
   to investigate the impact of digital platforms on competition. Based on
   a critical approach and grouping of alternative attitudes around market
   regulation and competition, a model was developed in which key problems
   and potential solutions were highlighted, as well as the wider effects
   of competition protection in the digital market. The conclusion of the
   analysis indicates that it is necessary to develop new tools and
   criteria for market analysis, ensure greater control over supervision of
   acquisitions, encourage information sharing both among market
   participants and with the Government, revise public procurement rules
   and introduce customized quality standards. The importance of a
   supportive competitive environment is emphasized.},

Abstract = {Digital markets are increasingly described as the `railroads' of the
   21st century. Extending that metaphor, some commentators argue we should
   revive stale railroad-era economic regulations and adapt them to the
   digital age. This enthusiasm appears to be buoyed by both a sudden
   nostalgia for railroad and airline regulations once administered by the
   Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and the Civil Aeronautics Board
   (CAB) and an equally sudden amnesia of the enormous harm those
   regulations caused to consumers. ICC and CAB regulations are indeed an
   apt metaphor, as they illustrate perfectly how sectoral regulations sold
   to the public as simple, clear, and cheap can go awry. Ultimately, a
   bipartisan consensus emerged to disband those agencies and deregulate
   those industries. After deregulation, prices fell, output expanded, and
   firms innovated. Proposals to regulate Big Tech today in a similar
   fashion forget these important lessons. We should know better than to do
   the same thing again today and expect a different result.},

Abstract = {Antitrust agencies around the world are increasingly focusing on digital
   industries. Critics have justifiably questioned the ability of
   competition agencies to make beneficial enforcement decisions given the
   complexity and rapid pace of change in online markets. This Article
   discusses those criticisms and addresses the argument that, because the
   error costs of overenforcement of antitrust laws in digital markets
   would be much higher than the error costs of underenforcement, courts
   and antitrust agencies should presume against antitrust intervention in
   digital industries. While acknowledging that there is often good reason
   for such modesty in enforcement, this Article discusses several ways in
   which competition policy can adjust to better account for potential
   costs and benefits of enforcement in digital platform markets. It argues
   that nonprice effects related to information and innovation are
   particularly important to the performance of online platforms, and may
   hold the key to a better understanding of the costs of antitrust
   underenforcement and the assessment of the competitive effects of
   conduct and transactions in digital industries.},

Abstract = {The article discusses topical issues of protection and regulation of
   competition in the markets in the digital business environment. The
   authors noted that the systems of regulation and law enforcement should
   be flexibly combined, harmonized in order to develop adequate measures
   to stimulate fair competition. From the standpoint of adaptation to
   Russian practice, the foreign experience of the antimonopoly authorities
   in terms of regulating online markets, price algorithms, and mergers and
   acquisitions has been studied. The high-tech sector is particularly
   dynamic. In this regard, the authors draw attention to the fact that in
   the digital economy of demand, the processes of monopolization,
   competition persist, but their content is transformed, which complicates
   the analysis and assessment of monopolization, dominance, competition.
   Anticompetitive practices can lead to the dominance of a single
   platform. The signs of the dominant position of digital platforms are
   revealed. Based on the regulatory and legal approach, the article
   summarizes the Russian and foreign experience of qualifying economic
   concentration and dominant position, identifies negative factors that
   cause the expansion of regulatory control of antimonopoly authorities
   over digital platforms. The legal nature of digital platforms, direct
   and indirect network effects have been studied in detail. It has been
   proven that algorithms can serve as collusion tools in both horizontal
   and vertical agreements. From the standpoint of economic research
   methods, an overview of the assessment of the dominant position of
   antimonopoly authorities in the digital economy is carried out, it is
   noted that the preconditions have been created for the formation of a
   platform economy. The features of the antitrust policy in relation to
   digital platforms in Russia, the European Union and the United States
   are considered. It is concluded that antitrust legislation in recent
   years has become a powerful regulatory tool at the level of different
   jurisdictions.},

Abstract = {Contrary to common belief, large digital platforms that deal directly
   with consumers, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, are not
   ``winner-take-all{''} firms. They must compete on the merits or
   otherwise rely on exclusionary practices to attain or maintain
   dominance, and this gives antitrust policy a role. While regulation may
   be appropriate in a few areas such as for consumer privacy, antitrust's
   firm-specific approach is more adept at addressing most threats to
   platform competition.
   When platforms exert their market power over other firms, liability may
   be apt, but remedies present another puzzle. For the several pending
   antitrust complaints against Google and Facebook, for instance, what
   should be the remedy if there is a violation? Breaking up large firms
   that benefit from extensive economies of scale and scope will injure
   consumers and most input suppliers, including the employees who supply
   labor. In many situations, a better approach would be to restructure
   management rather than assets, which would leave the platform intact as
   a production entity but make decisionmaking more competitive. A second
   option to breaking up firms would be to require interoperability-and in
   the information context, mandate the pooling of valuable information.
   These measures could promote competition and simultaneously increase the
   value of positive network effects.
   Finally, this Article examines another aspect of platforms-their
   acquisitions. For the most salient category of platform acquisitions of
   nascent firms, the greatest threat to competition comes from platforms'
   acquisitions of complements or differentiated technologies. Current
   merger-enforcement tools are ill suited to analyze this new variation on
   competitive harm. New approaches are required.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes antitrust regulations for Facebook and Google and
   the effects on competition in the digital market. A combination of
   economies of scale, network externalities, and the extraction,
   collection, storage and analysis of personal data allows both companies
   to hold market power within digital advertising. Its dominant position
   increases the price to advertisers, deteriorates user privacy, affects
   the free flow of information on the network, and prevents technological
   innovation. In 2019, these anticompetitive behaviors motivated the
   investigation of the US authorities on the Silicon Valley industries.
   This paper examines economic regulations that would promote competition

Title = {The Antitrust Duty to Deal in the Age of Big Tech},
Journal = {YALE LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {131},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1483-1558},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The antitrust duty to deal is perhaps the most confounding and
   controversial form of antitrust intervention. It is sought in situations
   where a monopolist controls a critical input (or ``essential
   facility{''}) and unilaterally refuses to sell access to rivals. Courts
   have substantially narrowed the doctrine in recent decades. However, the
   rise of dominant platforms like Google, Facebook, and Amazon has
   provoked intense debate over whether the antitrust duty to deal needs a
   revival. Many such platforms are accused of refusing to deal with (or
   discriminating against) rivals in adjacent markets.
   At present, all unilateral refusals are evaluated under a common
   standard, which is virtually impossible to satisfy. This paper
   identifies an important economic distinction between two types of
   refusal cases; it argues that they raise very different theories of harm
   and demand different standards of liability. In one line of cases, the
   defendant's conduct raises essentially the same theory of harm as tying
   or related vertical restraints. However, formalistic doctrine prevents
   courts from evaluating them as such. As a result, these cases do not
   receive meaningful scrutiny. This is problematic, because a large
   majority of meritorious refusal-to-deal cases fall into this category,
   as do almost all cases involving dominant platforms.
   In a separate line of cases, intervention is much harder to justify on
   economic policy grounds, as it risks chilling investment in valuable new
   technologies. Courts often acknowledge this investment concern in dicta,
   but the liability standard they apply-which focuses myopically on
   exclusion - ignores it. This has led to a major internal contradiction:
   courts are emphatic that a duty to deal is almost never warranted, but
   simple economic arguments show that the refusals in these cases are
   routinely exclusionary in precisely the sense that the law purports to
   condemn. This contradiction has spurred courts to erect suffocating
   evidentiary requirements, which now do most of the heavy lifting in
   practice.
   These rules bear little logical connection to exclusion, but they excel
   at reining in liability. The problem is, they also kill off all the
   meritorious cases.
   This Article argues that any effective reform must begin by
   disentangling these distinct lines of cases. Subjecting them to
   different liability standards would help to address many of the key
   concerns raised on both sides of the debate. The justifications for this
   approach are manifold. First, it protects investment incentives without
   needlessly stifling enforcement in meritorious cases. Second, it
   naturally limits antitrust scrutiny to cases in which intervention is
   most likely to be administrable. Third, it is exactly analogous to the
   way antitrust already treats other forms of unilateral conduct. Finally,
   this approach would allow for meaningful antitrust scrutiny of
   unilateral conduct by dominant platforms-an objective that has recently
   received bipartisan support in Congress-while remaining faithful to core
   antitrust principles.},

Abstract = {The sharing economy is a new industrial model that has been booming in
   China over the past decade. China's antimonopoly law, however, has
   stayed relatively dormant while this innovative business has been
   expanding. For this article, I have chosen Didi Chuxing (Didi), the
   largest online ride-hailing service provider in the Chinese market, as
   my research subject. Didi's rapid development mirrors the sharing
   economy's prosperity in China as well as challenges faced by
   antimonopoly law. Based on my observation of Didi's business expansion,
   I point out three major anticompetitive concerns: predatory pricing,
   abuse of a dominant position, and undue interference by government
   authorities. This article concludes by suggesting three ways to address
   these concerns. Firstly, it suggests strengthening the antimonopoly
   law's core value of efficiency, which could help law enforcers escape
   from the confinement of traditional antitrust concepts and adopt more
   flexible and efficient approaches to analyse companies' behaviours.
   Secondly, it suggests adjusting the merger control thresholds and
   developing more flexible rules to review behaviours related to a
   dominant position in the sharing economy. Thirdly, the Fair Competition
   Review System is expected to be an effective mechanism to prevent
   governments from unduly interfering in competition in the sharing
   economy.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the problem of platform power by probing current
   regulatory frameworks' basic assumptions about how tech firms operate in
   digital ecosystems. Platform power is generally assessed in terms of
   economic markets in which individual corporate actors harness
   technological innovations to compete fairly, thereby maximising consumer
   welfare. We propose three paradigmatic shifts in the conceptualisation
   of platform power. First, we suggest to expand the notion of consumer
   welfare to citizen wellbeing, hence addressing a broader scope of
   platform services' beneficiaries. Second, we recommend considering
   platform companies as part of an integrated platform ecosystem,
   acknowledging its interrelational, dynamic structure. And third, we
   shift attention from markets as level playing fields towards societal
   platform infrastructures where hierarchies and dependencies are built
   into their architecture. Reframing platform power may be a necessary
   condition for updating and integrating current regulatory regimes and
   policy proposals.},

Journal = {BRICS LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {121-147},
Abstract = {The paper considers the processes of platformatization of the economy
   and public government, which have become the last decade's primary
   trend. Analysis of the digital markets in Russia, China, and Europe
   proved the dominance of the digital platforms of large technology
   companies. According to the authors, the concentration of market power
   in digital platforms threatens a competitive environment in digital
   markets. In this regard, the demand for antitrust regulation of their
   activities is justified. Another legal challenge arises concerning the
   trend of creating public services on the digital platforms of large
   technology companies. The paper analyzes China's experience in the
   platformatization of legal proceedings, where the process of
   establishing online courts is conducted in close cooperation with the
   leading digital platforms of the PRC. In contrast to China, in Russia,
   the main focus is on combining public services, and information systems
   of various departments within a single platform to provide public
   services, with large technology companies acting as operators.
   Therefore, the authors conclude that it is necessary to strengthen legal
   mechanisms to protect citizens' rights and interests during the
   digitization of public services - primarily citizens' rights to data
   protection. The problems revealed demonstrate the necessity of a
   balanced approach to the legal regulation of digital platforms. While it
   is important to stimulate their development, it is necessary to limit
   the opportunities for violating the rights and interests of other
   participants in the digital environment.},

   regulation caused by the digitalization of the economy. The authors draw
   attention to the fact that for digital markets, the usual indicators of
   monopoly power, which could be used by a state market monitoring body,
   do not work. Indicators such as innovative technologies, intellectual
   property, and Big data are now coming to the fore.
   The authors note that in the context of the digitalization of the
   economic space and the development of markets for digital services,
   regulations should be revised and clarified, in accordance with which
   markets are monitored and a policy to protect competition is
   implemented.},

Abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT), the amount and smart use of data will
   determine whether or not a firm can compete successfully. Manufacturing
   firms will collect data through sensors in their devices and, at least
   in the cases of SMEs, likely store the collected data in the cloud,
   purchasing cloud services and storage from the large e-platform
   providers doubling as cloud providers. The e-platform providers will
   also collect data from users of their other services. These data are
   often generated by the same firms that purchase cloud services when they
   use the e-platforms to sell goods and services. Access to the data and
   to data analytics on fair business terms, and the possibility to switch
   cloud and service providers are vital for the SMEs and, in general, to
   create a competitive and vibrant IoT. However, cloud and e-platform
   customers seem to be facing difficulties. According to the EU
   Commission, SMEs are finding it particularly hard to engage cloud and
   e-platform providers, and to gain access to cloud services on
   reasonable, transparent terms. The contracts are skewed in favour of the
   cloud providers. The customers get locked in and may be obliged to agree
   not to assert any of their intellectual property rights vis-a-vis the
   cloud provider or the cloud provider's network. Moreover, the cloud and
   e-platform providers may under certain circumstances access and make use
   of the users' data, and that may give them a competitive advantage
   vis-a-vis the users, since the providers may have access to much more
   data, even data originating from the users' competitors, suppliers,
   customers, etc. They can thus use all the data available to them to
   obtain a fuller picture of whole industries, and they may use that
   advantage in data to leverage and enter users' markets. Indeed, they may
   use the data in the cloud for data-driven business strategies to enter
   the core market of the firms that have provided them with data in the
   first place. This article discusses whether competition law can address
   the conduct of the cloud and e-platform providers, so that firms may
   access and make use of all the possibilities that the IoT harbours.},

Abstract = {Antitrust enforcement against anticompetitive platform most favored
   nations (MFN) provisions (also termed pricing parity provisions) can
   help protect competition in online markets. An online platform imposes a
   platform MFN when it requires that providers using its platform not
   offer their products or services at a lower price on other platforms.
   These contractual provisions may be employed by a variety of online
   platforms offering, for example, hotel and transportation bookings,
   consumer goods, digital goods, or handmade craft products. They have
   been the subject of antitrust enforcement in Europe but have drawn only
   limited antitrust scrutiny in the United States. Our Feature explains
   why MFNs employed by online platforms can harm competition by keeping
   prices high and discouraging the entry of new platform rivals, through
   both exclusionary and collusive mechanisms, notwithstanding the
   possibility that some MFNs may facilitate investment by limiting
   customer freeriding. We discuss ways by which government enforcers in
   the United States and private plaintiffs could potentially reach
   anticompetitive platform MFNs under the Sherman Act, and the litigation
   challenges such cases present.},

Abstract = {In February 2021, the Ministry of Commerce Anti-monopoly Bureau of the
   People's Republic of China released the Antitrust Guidelines for the
   Platform Economy Industry. This announcement signaled more governmental
   supervision and governance with Internet-related business. In practice,
   tech giants have been suffering administrative penalties one after
   another. This study presents a review and analysis of the research
   literature on the monopoly quantitative models, outlining the components
   and concluding the implications for anti-monopoly. This paper delineates
   three main research topics relating to the monopoly models within the
   literature: the oligopoly, monopolistic competition, and Internet
   platform monopoly. The Cournot model, Bertrand model, Stackelberg model,
   and Innovational model represent the oligopoly studies when a small
   group of large sellers dominates the market. We then discuss the
   monopolistic competition models as the Krugman model, D-S Model, and
   Lancaster Model. We pay particular attention to the platform economy to
   reflect the new era of monopoly with Marshall's Dilemma After the
   summary and comparison of the literature research trajectory, our
   analysis culminates in implications for antitrust: why Internet
   corporations and government meet this monopoly predicament, who are
   involved by monopoly policy, how consumers and market got impacted, and
   what countermeasures could be taken to improve the antitrust. This study
   contributes to overview the development of monopoly models and
   critically analyze based on the current antitrust situation and trend of
   platform economy integration. We should scrutinize the feasibility to
   adopt engrain view of monopoly mechanisms as benefit loss on the
   information technology economy. Therefore, this research raises the
   novel question and synergistic effects of monopoly. (C) 2021 The

Abstract = {The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have largely
   abdicated their role to scrutinize and challenge mergers in zero-priced
   industries. This abdication derives from a Chicago School assumption
   that concentration in these industries will not lead to consumer harm.
   Due to the agencies' hands-off approach to merger review, the digital
   economy is rapidly concentrating as firms are permitted to acquire their
   competitors with no meaningful antitrust supervision. Increased
   consolidation of ownership is evident in the dating app industry. One
   firm has acquired twenty-five rival dating apps in the past decade and
   now operates over forty-five distinct dating sites, including Tinder,
   OkCupid, and Hinge. In this Note, I argue that increased concentration
   and decreased competition in the dating app sector can lead to three
   types of consumer harm: price discrimination, deterioration of quality,
   and reduced data privacy.},

Abstract = {The main aim of the present paper is to render the correlations between
   digital libraries and the laws applying to this domain. At present,
   digital libraries store millions of items in their archives, which are
   at the public's fingertips, in this context this phrase being
   susceptible of both a literal and a figurative meaning. At the same
   time, they improve cultural preservation and dissemination. The ongoing
   impact of such online collections of data can be related to multiple
   areas, such as technology, economics, and law. Concerning the legal
   aspect, digital libraries are facing copyright restrictions, being in a
   constant conflict of interests with those who own intellectual property
   rights over those particular works, namely authors, publishers, and so
   on. For this reason, such online archives will commonly encompass books
   which are not subject to copyright. A relevant example is the recent
   series of copyright trials against the gargantuan Google corporation,
   the respective rulings representing a valuable and up-to-date source of
   information regarding the current position of the judiciary on how the
   copyright laws and antitrust regulations apply to digital libraries.
   With reference to these issues, in the Copyright tradition, one of the
   limitations of the author's rights is represented by the so-called `fair
   use' doctrine, which attempts at creating a balance between the author's
   interest and that of the public. The reaction of the European Union to
   the trend of digitalisation is Europeana, the online multilingual
   library of Europe, a project initiated by the European Commission and
   launched in 2008. Moreover, on this occasion, the miscellaneous nature
   of the European legal framework was brought into light, raising
   awareness for forthcoming legislative proposals. Another notable aspect
   on the legal ground is the connection between digital libraries and
   electronic commerce. Thus, there are numerous aspects to be considered
   when approaching digital libraries from a legal point of view, the
   provisions under discussion belonging to various branches of law. The
   challenges brought about by the development of this highly dynamic
   domain reveal the need to re-think certain pieces of legislation. As a
   conclusion, a thorough description of the outstanding possibilities
   brought about by the digital era cannot be complete without an in-depth
   analysis of the digital library phenomenon, which, in the foreseeable
   future, is likely to change both research methods and the laws related
   to this field, moving towards a universal objective.},

Title = {Big Tech's Buying Spree and the Failed Ideology of Competition Law},
Journal = {HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL},

Pages = {465-516},

Abstract = {Big Tech is on a buying spree. Companies like Apple, Google, Facebook,
   and Amazon are gobbling up smaller companies at an unprecedented pace.
   But the law of competition isn't ready for Big Tech's endless appetite.
   Today's antitrust law is controlled by the Chicago School of Law and
   Economics. The Chicago School's ideological frame is toothless when a
   dominant firm purchases a startup that could be a future competitor.
   Under the ``potential competition{''} doctrine, the Chicago School is
   impotent to face the anti-competitive thread of Big Tech.
   This Article shows how the Chicago School of law and economics hobbles
   antitrust law and policy on potential competition mergers. It
   illustrates this problem with a close study of public information
   regarding Facebook. The Article assembles a database of Facebook's
   completed acquisitions-ninety in all-and shows how the ``potential
   competition{''} doctrine renders competition law entirely impotent to
   protect the consumer interest in this space. What is true for Facebook
   applies to the market generally. While we offer no opinion on any
   particular merger, protecting the consumer against the ravenous appetite
   of Big Tech requires rejecting the potential competition test and
   adopting the empirically tractable structural approach to potential
   competition mergers.},

Title = {Denaturalizing Digital Platforms: Is Mass Individualization Here to
   Stay?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {461-481},
Abstract = {This article examines the consistency of mass individualization or
   personalization techniques used by digital platforms with the
   imaginaries and logics of neoclassical economic theory and behavioral
   economics. We identify limitations of contemporary policy and regulatory
   responses to harms associated with datafication practices. We argue that
   more attention needs to be given to denaturalizing claims that
   enhancements of mass individualization techniques are a ``natural{''}
   outcome of digital technology innovation and market dynamics. To avoid
   harms associated with datafication and to secure public values, it is
   essential to imagine a future digital world that is not dependent on
   massive collection of individuals' data for commercial or public ends.
   This might require the blocking of some applications before, rather than
   after, they have been deployed. Doing so will require broad agreement
   that mass individualization techniques are inconsistent with valuing
   human autonomy and effective individual choice in Western societies.
   Skepticism about policy intervention in the platform market is answered
   by examining how surprising opportunities for change may arise from
   contestations of current applications of these technologies.},

Title = {Getting Antitrust and History in Tune},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ECONOMICS AND LAW-A CONVIVIUM},
Abstract = {Antitrust is high on the reform agenda at present, associated with calls
   to ``break up big tech.{''} Proponents of reform have invoked history
   with regularity in making their case. They say reform is essential to
   reverse the baleful influence of the Chicago School of antitrust, which,
   in their telling, disastrously and abruptly ended in the 1980s a
   ``golden{''} era of beneficially lively antitrust enforcement. In fact,
   antitrust enforcement was, at best, uneven, from the early 20th century
   through to the end of the 1970s. As for the antitrust
   ``counter-revolution{''} of the late 20th century, this was fostered as
   much by fears of foreign competition and skepticism of government
   regulation as Chicago School theorizing. The pattern helped to ensure
   that the counter-revolution was largely sustained through the opening
   decades of the 21st century. This article, in addition to getting
   antitrust and history in tune by drawing attention to the foregoing
   points, provides insights regarding antitrust's future direction.},

   and AI},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT},
Abstract = {While companies are targeting online shoppers with increased precision
   thanks to their combined use of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence,
   concerns have been expressed among competition law scholars that giant
   tech companies may use their enhanced market power resulting from their
   access and control of Big Data and AI to foreclose the market from
   potential competitors and subsequently charge higher prices to
   consumers. If proven, such practices amount to abuses of dominance in
   the meaning of Article 102 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the
   European Union. The recent adoption by the European Commission of its
   proposal for a Regulation on the Digital Markets Act aiming at setting
   up rules to ensure that markets characterized by large platforms acting
   as gatekeepers, remain fair and contestable and the launch of a new
   string of investigations by the European Commission into possible
   anti-competitive conducts of Google Amazon, Apple, and Facebook have
   shown that these concerns are not purely hypothetical.},

Title = {Should We Regulate Digital Platforms? A New Framework for Evaluating
   Policy Options},
Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {264-301},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The economic and societal impact of digital platforms raises a number of
   questions for policymakers, including whether existing regulatory
   approaches and instruments are sufficient to promote and safeguard
   public interests. This article develops a practical framework that
   provides structure and guidance to policymakers who design policies for
   the digital economy. The framework differs from other approaches in
   taking the digital business models of platforms as the starting point
   for the analysis. The framework consists of three pillars, namely
   determining a platform's characteristics, relating these to public
   interests, and formulating policy options. The framework then invokes a
   return-path analysis for assessing how the interventions affect the
   business model, whether it has the desired effect on public interests,
   and ensuring it has no undesired side-effects on public interests. The
   framework puts forward two key messages for current discussions on
   digital platforms. First, one should look at the underlying
   characteristics of platforms rather than trying to understand digital
   platforms as a single category. Second, policymakers should explore
   existing rules and policy options, as they seem fit to deal with several
   characteristics of digital platforms in a time frame that matches the
   rapid development of platform technologies and business models.

Title = {Big data at the crossroads of antitrust and consumer protection {*}},
Journal = {INFORMATION ECONOMICS AND POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {54},
Number = {SI},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The rise of big data in the global economy has led to concerns about
   antitrust and consumer protection, but policy makers often treat the two
   areas separately. The separate treatment is justified in classical
   markets because antitrust tends to focus on firm-to-firm interactions,
   while consumer protection deals with firm-to-consumer interfaces. The
   two areas may also be subject to different laws, and any crossovers
   between the two have tended to be small. However, big data blurs the
   distinction between the two, causing them to intertwine, complement or
   even conflict with each other. This paper uses examples to illustrate
   why that is the case and identifies areas that would benefit from more
   economic research.

Abstract = {Intensifying concerns about online platform firms' rapid rise,
   expansion, and growing asymmetric power have attracted political
   scrutiny and undermined the legitimacy of a minimalist regulatory regime
   that is giving way to intense debate and increasingly interventionist
   governmental policies and enforcement actions. First, we view the rise
   of, and recent political responses to, the often-predatory power and
   manipulative conduct of platform firm in terms of a `Polanyian' double
   movement in which the destabilising and destructive effects of unchecked
   corporate activities and market development eventually generates
   political and regulatory responses to constrain private power that
   threaten the social, political, and economic order. Second, incipient
   legal changes, most notably the EU's proposed Digital Markets Act and
   Digital Services Act, indicate a shift in regulatory emphasis from
   competition (and antitrust) policy and law towards more intensive and
   encompassing forms of socio-economic regulation. Finally, these
   regulatory changes will likely vary in character and significance across
   political jurisdictions, and embody distinctive and possibly divergent
   developmental trajectories. The EU may have a first-mover advantage in
   regulating platform firms, but we are only at the very beginning of a
   protracted and conflictual transformational process.},

Abstract = {News media businesses compete with search engines and social media
   networks for advertising revenue but at the same time depend on the
   latter to reach and interact with audiences. The Digital Platforms
   Inquiry (DPI) completed by the Australian Competition and Consumer
   Commission (ACCC) found that media businesses' dependency on digital
   platforms gives companies like Google and Facebook substantial
   bargaining power over Australian news media businesses. This development
   over the past decade has caused negative repercussions for the choice
   and quality of news available to Australians. In response to thegse
   findings, Australia's News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory
   Bargaining Code 2021 extends the application of competition law into
   digital news and advertising markets. The reform is intended to address
   the impact of digital platforms on the commercial viability of
   Australian news companies. In this article, we assess the application of
   competition law to the relationship between news media and digital
   platforms, including the strength of the DPI findings and the
   appropriateness of the resulting reforms. We argue that after decades of
   deregulation of the media sector in Australia the News Media Bargaining
   Code is a hybrid legislation, which introduces news media industry
   regulations under the guise of competition law. While we see a continued
   role for competition law in digital platform markets, this article
   indicates the challenges posed by digital platforms on media pluralism
   and the limitations of a market-driven approach to news media policy.},

Title = {Separation: A Cure for Abuse of Platform Dominance?},
Journal = {INFORMATION ECONOMICS AND POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {54},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Political candidates, legislators, and academics have made proposals to
   separate services provided by dominant digital platforms from activities
   that rely on these services. Although the platforms have different
   economic and technical characteristics, common themes that motivate
   these proposals are the incentives of platforms to favor their own
   products and to suppress investment by imitating rivals. As has been
   shown in other contexts, this paper demonstrates that structural
   separation does not eliminate incentives for platforms to discriminate
   in the provision of service quality. Furthermore, the ability of
   vertically integrated platforms to imitate rivals does not necessarily
   harm consumers. Structural or functional separation can address some
   complaints lodged against activities by dominant platforms, but
   experience demonstrates that separation requirements are difficult to
   administer and can harm innovation. Public policy should rely on a mix
   of antitrust enforcement and regulation to address concerns about
   privacy, data security, and potential influence of major platforms in
   politics and the media, as well as the abuse of market power. (c) 2020

Abstract = {The peculiarities of multi-sided markets set them apart from the
   traditional market paradigm entrenched in the antitrust policy
   framework. Working of platforms has posed antitrust issues and concerns,
   which cannot be dealt using the current rules. This does not imply that
   the new learnings on the economics of platforms cannot be incorporated
   into the adjudication of competition law or that Indian competition law
   is inflexible to accommodate the new insights. This article discusses
   how the conduct of platforms raises competitive ambiguity. Strategies
   that are considered harmful in standard economic literature may have a
   pro-competitive rationale. Such markets, generally, have a tendency to
   become concentrated with rapid innovation by firms. In this dynamic
   environment, the authorities should not pursue an ex ante agenda in
   trying to address a possibility of consumer harm and intervene only when
   anti-competitive harm is clearly identifiable. The enforcement should
   exclusively target objectionable activities that hurt consumers (not
   protect some competitors) leaving other pro-competitive conduct that
   benefit consumers unregulated.},

Volume = {9},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We analyze a search engine market from a law and economics perspective
   and incorporate the choice of quality-improving innovations by a search
   engine platform in a two-sided model of Internet search engine. In the
   proposed framework, we first discuss the legal issues the search engine
   market raises for antitrust policy through analysis of several types of
   abusive behavior by the dominant platform. We also explore possible
   consequences of monopolization of the search engine market for
   advertisers and users in the form of excessive pricing and deterioration
   of the quality of the search results. Second, in the technical analysis
   part, we incorporate these considerations in a two-sided market model
   and analyze the rate of innovation, pricing, and quality choices by the
   dominant search engine. Our findings show that a dominant monopoly
   platform results in higher prices and underinvestment in
   quality-improving innovations by a search engine relative to the social
   optimum. More generally, we show that monopoly is sub-optimal in terms
   of harm to advertisers in the form of excessive prices, harm to users in
   the form of reduction in quality of search results, as well as harm to
   the society in the form of lower innovation rates in the industry.},

   HARM TO CONSUMERS?},
Journal = {REVISTA DIREITO GV},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {This article proposes, in the light of the evolution of the traditional
   vision of retail supermarkets, a modern antitrust analysis of this
   sector, seeking to overcome the idea that supermarkets appear as neutral
   agents of the market, hence the market power in supermarket retailer can
   impact on the competition field. Thus, this article studies the
   supermarkets as two-sided platforms with characteristics of the
   competitive bottleneck. According to the two-sided platform theory, the
   supermarkets should be analyzed as service providers for final consumers
   and suppliers, noting that these two distinct groups depend on the
   supermarket for the intermediation of transactions, which means that
   there are indirect externalities between the two groups and,
   consequently, confers bargaining power to the platform. Furthermore,
   according to the theory of bottlenecks to competition, it can be argued
   that the retail supermarket has a monopoly power to provide access to
   one group or another. This proposal, as this article seeks to
   demonstrate, brings with it a new way of understanding the possible
   legal relationships of the agents in the retail supermarket, in their
   vertical, horizontal and diagonal relations.},

Abstract = {Antitrust law has largely failed to address the challenges posed by
   digital markets. At the turn of the millennium, the antitrust enterprise
   engaged in intense debate over whether antitrust doctrine, much of it
   developed during a bygone era of smokestack industries, could or should
   evolve to address digital markets. Eventually, a consensus emerged:
   although the basic doctrine is supple enough to apply to new
   technologies, courts and enforcers should adopt a defendant-friendly,
   hands-off approach.
   But this pro-defendant position is deeply-and dangerously-flawed.
   Economic theory, empirical research, and extant judicial and regulatory
   authority all contradict the prevailing views regarding power, conduct,
   and efficiencies in digital markets. Far from being self-correcting,
   digital markets facilitate the creation and maintenance of uniquely
   durable market power. Digital markets are conducive to complex
   anticompetitive strategies that have largely escaped regulatory
   scrutiny. Perhaps most importantly, digital-market conduct tends to lack
   significant offsetting efficiencies.
   As a result, the consensus view is ripe for rejection. Digital markets
   do require a different approach, but it must be uniquely
   interventionist, not unusually laissez-faire. This Article concludes by
   offering a set of doctrinal and policy proposals aimed at creating a
   more robust, vigilant, and welfare-enhancing digital antitrust
   enterprise.},

Abstract = {In a speech, Paul A. Johnson discussed how network effects may affect
   competition analysis. Network effects arise when a product's value to
   one consumer increases with consumption by others. But competition can
   fragment a market so that network effects may not be enjoyed. Products
   that rely on algorithmic analysis of big data and exhibit network
   effects are growing increasingly important in the economy. In response,
   should antitrust enforcement become less aggressive so as to allow the
   benefits of network effects to be enjoyed? This note answers that
   question in the negative based on a lack of clear consensus in the
   literature that the benefits of network effects outweigh the benefits of
   competition. As antitrust confronts new business models enabled by new
   technologies, the analysis also serves as a reminder of the importance
   of postulating theories that are scientific in the sense that they can
   be falsified.},

Abstract = {A large proportion of our online activity takes place through a handful
   of platforms. With increased hostility towards the prevalence of
   vertical integration in tech markets and calls for the breaking up of
   profitable technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and
   Microsoft, the time is ripe to devise antitrust rules that sensibly
   approach the relationship between platform operators and firms that
   compete within their ecosystems. This article analyses situations where
   platform operators design their platforms in such a way that is liable
   to exclude intra-platform competitors. There are certain intricacies of
   exclusion in intra-platform markets that existing theories of harm in
   antitrust law do not anticipate; thus, applying those theories
   unyieldingly is liable to cause confusion and result in judicial error.
   Existing cases reveal that some authorities and courts have been taking
   a sensible approach to intra-platform exclusion since the early 2000s
   whereas others, especially in the EU, have shown a tendency to protect
   excluded intra-platform firms at the expense of consumer welfare.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the potential impacts of the emergence and growth
   of electronic commerce on industrial organizational attributes such as
   ease-of-entry, seller concentration and average firm size. While much of
   the relevant literature argues that electronic commerce will profoundly
   change the industrial organizational attributes of a range of markets,
   primarily in the direction of making those markets more contestable,
   this paper offers a more guarded and qualified appraisal. Specifically,
   electronic commerce will generally reduce barriers to entry, seller
   concentration and average firm size; however, these effects are likely
   to be modest for many products, especially for those that are either
   ``experience{''} goods or ``credence{''} goods. Anti-trust laws will not
   be rendered obsolete by electronic commerce; however, antitrust
   authorities may need to reorder their priorities.},

Title = {PRICE ALGORITHMS AS A THREAT TO COMPETITION UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF
   DIGITAL ECONOMY: APPROACHES TO ANTIMONOPOLY LEGISLATION OF BRICS
   COUNTRIES},
Journal = {BRICS LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},

Pages = {94-117},
Abstract = {The authors examine certain legal problems of antitrust regulation in
   the digital economy facing the international community, including BRICS
   member countries. This article focuses on the problems associated with
   the use of price algorithms by enterprises as a threat factor to
   competition. The concept of ``price algorithm{''} and the goals of its
   use by enterprises are analyzed; it is concluded that the use of price
   algorithms is just one of the tools for conducting economic activity. At
   the same time, enterprises can pose a threat to competition by using
   price algorithms as an element of concluding anti-competitive agreements
   (concerted actions) between enterprises and illegal coordination of
   their activities. Restriction of competition through the use of price
   algorithms can harm consumers of goods, works, and services and should
   be controlled by antitrust authorities. Based on the analysis of the
   antitrust laws of the BRICS member countries, it is concluded that
   currently the concept of a pricing algorithm{''} is not enshrined in the
   laws of any of the BRICS member states, however, there are prohibitions
   on anticompetitive agreements of enterprises and illegal coordination of
   economic activity. We refute the need to legally enshrine the concept of
   ``price algorithm{''} in antitrust law. At the same time, it proves that
   enterprises should be held accountable for the use of the price
   algorithm as a tool to limit competition. The paper proves that within
   the framework of interstate cooperation of the BRICS countries in the
   field of competition law, it is necessary to develop common approaches
   to antitrust regulation in the digital economy, including to ensure a
   uniform approach to regulating and controlling the use of price
   algorithms by enterprises in the framework of economic activity.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With its decision in Ohio v. American Express, the U.S. Supreme Court
   for the first time embraced the recently developed, yet increasingly
   prolific, concept of the two-sided platform. Through advances in
   technology, platforms, which serve as intermediaries allowing two groups
   to transact, are increasingly ubiquitous, and many of the biggest tech
   companies operate in this fashion. Amazon Marketplace, for example,
   provides a platform for third-party vendors to sell directly to
   consumers through Amazon's web and mobile interfaces.
   At the same time that platforms and their scholarship have evolved, a
   burgeoning antitrust movement has also developed which focuses on the
   impact of the dominance of these tech companies and the fear that
   current antitrust laws are ill-equipped to prevent any potential
   anticompetitive behavior. Many of those who feel this way worried that
   American Express, which decided whether a plaintiff alleging
   anticompetitive behavior by a two-sided platform would have to show harm
   to both sides of the market to make a prima facie case, would give
   companies like Amazon even more power. This Note argues that while the
   case could be interpreted in such a way, because Amazon and similarly
   situated platforms possess a great degree of control over their users-in
   some cases competing with them directly-it would be unwise to do so.},

Title = {Giants among us: do we need a new antitrust paradigm?},
Journal = {CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Abstract = {Traditional antitrust policy was formulated to control pricing and
   output decisions that were not disciplined by competitive forces, either
   because of monopoly power or agreements in restraint of trade. Because
   there is no single criterion for evaluating political policy outcomes,
   antitrust regulators eventually settled on the ``consumer welfare
   standard,{''} correctly recognizing that any other standard was
   incoherent. Recently ``platforms{''} (defined here as firms or apps that
   solve the key transaction costs problems of triangulation, transfer, and
   trust) have tended toward giantism. This had led to calls for a new
   approach to antitrust, restoring the old multiple set of goals. But
   every platform by definition defines an industry, and is a monopoly
   within that industry. Such network economies or advantages in managing
   trust are the reasons platforms exist in the first place. This paper
   reviews the history of antitrust, defines platforms and the problems of
   ``giantism,{''} and suggests some policies that certainly won't work and
   should be abandoned. The problem is power, not monopoly. So power is
   what the ``new paradigm{''} needs to address.},

Title = {The competition for India's antitrust jurisdiction: Competition
   Commission versus sectoral regulators},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT},
Abstract = {A string of judgments by Indian courts have downgraded the Competition
   Commission of India's position in the adjudicatory hierarchy by
   requiring it to await the findings of sectoral regulators before
   initiating its own investigation. This article argues that the reasons
   advanced for deferring the Commission's jurisdiction are erroneous.
   Further, the judicial test for deferral of the Commission's jurisdiction
   is fraught with deficiencies and would inordinately delay or de facto
   divest the Commission of its jurisdiction. Some recent cases are trying
   to break away from this trend. One final battle though remains to be
   fought. With the emergence of competition issues in data protection and
   privacy related cases and the imminent establishment of data
   regulator(s) in India, the Commission will soon have an opportunity to
   push courts to re-examine and re-interpret existing judicial principles
   and reclaim its relative position in the adjudicatory hierarchy.},

Abstract = {The proposition that certain digital platforms act as `regulators'
   within their own business models is a key pillar of the European
   Commission report on Competition Policy for the Digital Era, and the
   basis upon which its authors build a wide-ranging duty for dominant
   platforms to secure competition that is `fair, unbiased and pro-users'.
   This article seeks to shed light on this novel contention, exploring its
   meaning and the implications for platform operators. It considers the
   rationale provided within the report and compares the approach with
   established Article 102 TFEU case law, specifically the `special
   responsibility' doctrine. Consideration is further given to whether the
   platforms-as-regulators notion aligns with alternative modes of
   regulation within the digital sphere. The aim is to explore whether this
   approach is coherent, and actually useful, as a means by which to frame
   and direct future enforcement against digital platforms.},

Title = {The Proposed EU Digital Markets Act: A New Era for the Digital Economy
   in Europe},

Abstract = {The analysis presented in this article suggests that the Digital Markets
   Act (DMA) would be a game-changer for the digital economy. From a legal
   perspective, the DMA should be regarded as a sector-specific, `ex ante'
   regulation, i. e., a `lex specialis' in relation to the general EU
   competition law, which relies on ` ex post' enforcement. The DMA
   restricts self- interested behaviour by ` big tech' and grants smaller
   competitors affirmative competitive rights, even where there is no
   anticompetitive behaviour by big tech under general EU competition law.
   By its terms, the DMA is aimed at ensuring ` contestable and fair
   digital markets', irrespective of consumer welfare. To achieve this
   objective, it will impose generic obligations on big tech that resemble
   remedies previously employed by the Commission in specific antitrust
   enforcement measures or that address antitrust complaints that the
   Commission is currently investigating.
   Unlike conventional EU competition law, despite the DMA's stated
   purpose, its main effect is not protection of European internet users (
   although they may benefit indirectly), but the protection of smaller
   European competitors against US `big tech'. These smaller competitors
   would no longer need to resort to the current system of ex post
   enforcement against abuse of monopoly power, which is believed to be
   insufficiently equipped to deal with digital monopoly power. Antitrust
   proceedings take a long time (five years or more is no exception), and
   in the meantime the competitive harm can increase. In many cases, the
   DMAwould make reliance on this slow, ex post enforcement program
   unnecessary. Instead, it would enable `ex ante' enforcement actions to
   ensure competitive markets under the threat of very large fines. Due to
   its far- reaching terms, the DMA would likely require changes to the
   business models of big tech. The DMA restates Adam Smith's famous quip
   `{[} i] t is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the
   baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own
   interest'. For the digital economy, the saying would be rewritten as: `
   It is not from the regard for their own interest of the gatekeepers that
   we expect our dinner, but from their benevolence'. Mandatory ` big tech
   benevolence' may well benefit ` business users', i. e., people or
   companies that use platforms to provide goods or services to internet
   users. Changes in big tech's business models prompted by the DMA,
   however, might also affect free internet services. In any event, the
   DMAwould give rise to significant changes and friction in the operation
   of the digital economy, which may result in frequent disputes and
   enforcement actions.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we undertake a stakeholder analysis of the Australian
   Competition and Consumer Commission's Digital Platforms Inquiry to
   understand the nature and influence of different forms of public input.
   Our findings show that nation-state regulation of digital platforms is
   now very much on the policy agenda worldwide, with a focus upon the
   competition policy dimensions of platform regulation. The second key
   finding is that the regulatory activism of the ACCC have ensured that
   the Inquiry and its findings have had maximum public impact. Finally, we
   argue that the key dynamic shaping the Inquiry was the competing demands
   of the traditional news media publishers and digital platforms, and that
   civil society input was relatively limited and secondary to the final
   recommendations.},

Title = {The economic case against licensing negotiation groups in the Internet
   of Things},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT},
Abstract = {Competition policy generally prohibits coordination among buyers or
   sellers, especially coordination on price, price-related inputs, and
   output. In licensing markets for standard-essential patents (SEPs), it
   has been periodically proposed that this rule should be relaxed to
   permit licensing negotiation groups (LNGs), which is expected to reduce
   transaction costs and the purportedly `excessive' royalties paid to
   licensors. Based on the economic structure and historical performance of
   wireless technology markets, this policy intervention is likely to
   degrade, rather than enhance, competitive conditions in the wireless,
   automotive, and other markets encompassed by the `Internet of Things'.
   In the short term, LNGs would most likely result in a redistributive
   (not an efficiency) effect that shifts value from innovators to
   implementers in the technology supply chain without necessarily passing
   on cost-savings to consumers. In the medium to longer term, LNGs are
   liable to impose efficiency losses by endangering the viability of
   licensing-based monetization models that have funded research and
   development, promoted dissemination of technology inputs, facilitated
   entry in device production, and enabled business models across multiple
   industries. While LNGs may reduce the transaction costs of SEP
   licensing, the historical record shows that pooling structures can
   achieve the same objective at a substantially lower risk of competitive
   harm.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes a corpus of segments from the Tucker Carlson Tonight
   program concerning ``big tech{''} (focusing specifically on Google) and
   contextualizes this analysis within the political history of American
   media and technology regulation. Conservatives have long lamented the
   so-called liberal bias in media, but have also traditionally supported
   business deregulation and an antitrust approach narrowly concerned with
   consumer welfare. The textual analysis of Fox segments first shows that
   recurring complaints about the bias of Google's employees and executives
   is connected with its market dominance, and they frequently position
   corporations rather than government as the central threat to freedom.
   The solutions discussed, correspondingly, often favor greater structural
   intervention in the market to mitigate concentration's deleterious
   political consequences. I show how the critique on Carlson's show and
   recent attention to the issue from the executive branch represent a new
   manifestation of the theory of ideological evolution that Jack Balkin
   has called ``ideological drift,{''} in which a political idea (in this
   case, the ``Brandeisian{''} approach to antitrust law) changes valence
   in different material circumstances and thus finds new proponents.},

Abstract = {Conceived in the 1930s as a way to renew free market liberalism,
   neoliberal doctrines aim to institute a competitive order that would
   regulate the market as well as society. Yet, interpretations of how
   competition should be enforced have varied throughout history. The
   European Union, with its ordoliberal origins, tends to follow an
   interventionist approach while the United States, where the Chicago
   School has gained influence, fears that inadequate public interventions
   may diminish global efficiency. The digital revolution and the
   appearance of the Tech Giants introduces a new challenge. Faced with
   massive increasing returns to scale, the competition authorities
   initially reduced their interventionism to enjoy more market efficiency.
   But the emergence of digital platforms and the will to protect personal
   data from abusive uses pushes them now to adopt a new strategy for more
   interventions that goes beyond the economic and efficiency issues. This
   article argues that the neoliberal vision is no longer accurate to
   regulate the digital economy. It shows that the platform economy is not
   an alternative way to manage the market, but an alternative to the
   market itself. To face these issues, a completely new conception of
   public regulation is therefore needed.},

Abstract = {The rise of Big Tech led to a still ongoing debate over the shape of
   antitrust enforcement. Many of such discussions take place in the United
   States and focus on the validity of consumer welfare standard, often
   leading each party of the discussion to entrench its position. In the
   European context, however, the success of the consumer welfare standard
   was never so full as in the United States, making way instead to the
   adoption of a `more economic approach'. This article discusses how the
   current tension within antitrust could be looked at from the European
   point of view. It suggests that antitrust might be subject to a
   perpetual movement between what has already been described in European
   antitrust as the more economic approach and what could be now termed as
   a more political approach. The article investigates what elements could
   be seen as part of such a more political approach. It leaves aside the
   question of which approach is the `correct' one and attempts instead to
   look for ways of adjusting enforcement in times of change. The article
   concludes that while the more economic and more political approach are
   at odds, there appear to be ways of easing tensions within antitrust
   when political conditions change.},

   AT\&T-Time Warner merger},
Journal = {CRITICAL DISCOURSE STUDIES},
Abstract = {A key discourse underpinning US antitrust law is that it protects
   competition, not competitors. However, what this means in practice both
   has changed over time and betrays the politics underlying antitrust
   enforcement. This article interrogates this discourse and its
   contradictions in the context of the AT\&T-Time Warner merger lawsuit
   through a critical discourse analysis of legal documents related to the
   case. The case represents a conflict over incentivizing competition in
   digital advertising markets at the expense of competition, particularly
   smaller competitors, in video markets. The analysis reveals how the
   discourse obscures the strategic choices made by courts to protect
   incumbent companies: by approving the merger, the court circumscribed
   the video programming and distribution market for consolidation to
   strengthen the competitive position of the merging parties in the
   digital advertising market dominated by Facebook and Google. Thus, this
   discourse masks not just the deference to dominant merging companies,
   but also the role of courts in shaping market competition at their
   behest.},

Abstract = {An unprecedented recalibration of the rules regulating the functioning
   of competition in the digital markets has catalysed diverse reactions
   among the main stakeholders. The proposed approach to regulating
   gatekeepers will have a paradigmatic impact on European consumers,
   businesses and public institutions. It will have equally significant
   implications for the theoretical foundations of competition law,
   economics and policy. While formally the Digital Markets Act (DMA) is
   complementing, not substituting, existing provisions of competition de
   lege lata, such a substantial extension of the rationale and instruments
   of competition policy is likely to have significant implications also
   for the application of ex-post rules. The entire apparatus of
   competition law will be extended by the new modality. Out of the wide
   spectrum of changes introduced by the DMA/DSA proposal, this article
   identifies and analyses one of the central though not so commonly
   discussed - elements of the transformation. It asks a normative question
   about what kind of competition in the digital markets the European Union
   should seek to establish, and a methodological question about procedural
   and substantive legal mechanisms used for shaping such a new format.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {105},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-106},
Abstract = {One of the chief anticompetitive effects of modern business lies in
   antitrust's blind spot. Platform-based companies ({''}platforms{''})
   have mastered a business model whereby they offer users ``free{''} and
   low-priced services in exchange for their personal information. With
   this data, platforms can design products, target advertising, and sell
   user information to third parties. The problem is that platforms can
   inflict greater costs on users and markets in the form of lost privacy
   than the efficiencies generated from their low prices. As an example,
   users spend billions of dollars annually to remedy privacy breaches and,
   indirectly but alarmingly, many users participate without realization in
   experiments designed to manipulate their behaviors, compromising their
   agency. But because antitrust's framework typically uses consumer prices
   to measure welfare, platforms and privacy injuries have largely avoided
   antitrust scrutiny.
   We argue that insufficient competition enables platforms to capture the
   economic benefits of data while externalizing the costs of protecting
   it. Consumers demand privacy yet firms in monopolized markets have
   powerful incentives to shift the costs of protecting privacy onto
   society. To reduce the rate of privacy breaches, an increase of
   competition would (1) allow users to punish offending firms, (2)
   disseminate information about the true costs of privacy, and (3)
   introduce more secure services into the market. Because monopoly power
   encourages firms to disregard the privacy demands of users, antitrust
   must evolve to recognize that the costs of inadequate privacy can
   degrade consumer welfare more than artificially high prices.},

Abstract = {The increasing collection of personal data by online platforms causes
   concerns among regulators and consumers. Due to privacy-related market
   failures in multi-sided markets, the question of possible remedies
   arises. This article aims to determine if a contribution of competition
   law is needed to enhance data protection rules. The first part will
   discuss the possible types of data-related abuses of dominance in the
   context of the pioneering attempt of the German competition authority.
   The second part will analyse the drawbacks of the German Facebook case
   and possibilities to reconcile it with EU competition law. In addition,
   the article will analyse other ways to tackle privacy issues, including
   the proposal for a Digital Markets Act (DMA). It is suggested that an
   intervention of competition law in data protection matters is
   unnecessary. We argue that it may prevent the emergence of innovative
   products and services, ultimately harm consumer welfare and competition,
   as well as put an undue burden on dominant undertakings. It is submitted
   that a coherent regulation allowing for legal certainty could serve the
   objective of consumer welfare while preserving the interests of
   undertakings.},

Title = {Antitrust liability for licensing boards after North Carolina Dental:
   antitrust preemption as a penalty default?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-21},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Most professions in the USA are regulated by boards composed of industry
   practitioners, who in their official roles routinely engage in
   anticompetitive conduct. Until the Supreme Court's landmark decision in
   North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners v FTC, many believed that
   such conduct was beyond the reach of antitrust enforcement as long as it
   was taken pursuant to state policy to displace competitiona standard met
   with relative ease. After North Carolina Dental, states now must
   additionally take ownership of the anticompetitive actions of these
   boards to avoid the full force of the antitrust laws. In this manner,
   North Carolina Dental has the potential to prompt a large-scale
   restructuring of the state regulatory apparatus. This article explores
   the potential for antitrust preemption to play a role in this
   restructuring. I argue that, to the extent that unsupervised boards'
   anticompetitive conduct would be justified only by non-competition
   concerns, they are rendered defenceless in any rule of reason inquiry.
   As such, the conduct at issue is subject to a de facto per se standard,
   potentially subjecting the law authorizing such conduct to antitrust
   preemption. Rather than adjusting the rule of reason inquiry to allow
   courts to weigh non-competition concerns in these cases, the better
   alternative would be to preempt the laws altogether. This approach has
   several advantages. First, it would avoid a dissonance between antitrust
   and due process inquiries into the same conduct. Secondly, it would act
   as a penalty default for states, and like penalty defaults in contracts,
   such a rule would assign the regulatory decision to the low-cost
   information provider-the state, rather than the court. Finally, this
   approach vindicates federalism to a greater extent than a modified rule
   of reason. The only role for a federal court under a preemption approach
   would be to uphold or strike down the law granting the board authority
   to engage in the suspect conduct. This decision, moreover, would be
   based on an objective analysis of the board's regulatory structure,
   rather than a subjective weighing of competition and non-competition
   concerns.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {775-792},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper shows that two related aspects of attention platforms are
   important for the sound economic analysis of public policy including
   antitrust: first, attention platforms generate valuable content. Even
   though people often don't pay for content, we know from revealed
   preference that content is valuable because people spend a considerable
   amount of timewhich has an opportunity costconsuming it. Second, demand
   for advertising and the supply of content are interdependent. A decrease
   in the demand for advertising reduces the returns to supplying content
   and therefore the amount of content that is provided. Accounting for the
   value of content and these positive feedbacks cannot determine optimal
   interventions; but failing to do so can result in policies that reduce
   consumeras well as advertiserwelfare. The paper then considers the
   implications of these considerations for public policy: particularly
   privacy regulation and antitrust enforcement. From the standpoint of
   promoting consumer welfare, the failure to account for the value of
   content and the ad-content interdependencies increases the chances that
   authorities do not intervene when they should and do intervene when they
   should not.},

Title = {THE ANTITRUST CASE AGAINST THE APPLE APP STORE},

Abstract = {The Apple App Store is the only channel through which app developers may
   distribute their apps on iOS. First launched in 2008, the App Store has
   evolved into a highly profitable marketplace, with overall consumer
   spend exceeding \$50 billion in 2019. However, concerns are being
   increasingly expressed on both sides of the Atlantic that various
   practices of Apple with regard to the App Store may breach competition
   law. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether this is indeed the
   case and, if so, how these concerns can be addressed. With these aims in
   mind, the paper first introduces the reader to the app ecosystem and the
   Apple App Store, with a focus on Apple's in-app payment policies and the
   30 percent commission charged for in-app purchases. After engaging
   critically with the distinction between apps selling ``digital{''} and
   apps selling ``physical{''} goods or services, we consider such
   distinction is unclear, artificial, and unprincipled.
   The paper then critically reviews several practices of Apple that appear
   to be at odds with competition law and in particular Article 102 TFEU.
   We first analyze the issue of market definition and dominance with
   regard to the App Store. We find that Apple is a monopolist in the
   market for app distribution on iOS, as it is not subject to any
   meaningful competitive constraint from alternative distribution
   channels, such as Android app stores. The result is that Apple is the
   gateway through which app developers have to go to reach the valuable
   audience of iOS users. This bottleneck position affords Apple the power
   to engage in several prima facie anticompetitive practices. A first
   concern is that Apple may exploit app developers by charging excessive
   fees for the services it provides and by imposing unfair trading
   conditions. Second, based on four case studies, the paper illustrates
   how Apple may use its control of the App Store or iOS to engage in
   exclusionary behavior to the detriment of rival apps. These practices
   should be investigated by competition authorities, as they are likely to
   result in considerable consumer harm, be it in the form of higher app
   prices, worse user experience or reduced consumer choice. The paper
   finally proposes a combination of concrete remedies that would address
   the competition concerns identified.},

Abstract = {Although experimentalist governance - presented as a novel alternative
   to conventional hierarchical governance - has attracted attention over
   the past 15 years, we still know little about its real spread and scope
   conditions. Examining the application of competition policy to the
   digital sector, the article reveals that the European Competition
   Network and the procedures modernized in the early 2000s actually host a
   variety of governance processes, ranging from hierarchical development
   and enforcement of stable solutions at one extreme to experimentalist
   discretion of local actors, review of their implementation experiences,
   and central revisions in their light at the other. Futher, shifts from
   hierarchy to experimentalism might reverse. As for explanations,
   variation in governance processes cannot be explained by formal
   distributions of power, which were the same. Instead, the greater the
   uncertainty about solutions and the weaker the readily available
   coalitions in their support, the more actors favored experimentalist
   governance, and vice versa. The broader implications thus caution
   against general claims, challenge the influence of legal factors, and
   suggest that far from being necessarily antitethical, functional and
   political factors may bear together on the spread of distinct forms of
   governance.},

Abstract = {Multisided platforms are ubiquitous in today's economy. Although
   newspapers demonstrate that the platform business model is scarcely new,
   recent economic analysis has explored more deeply the manner of its
   operation. Drawing upon these insights, we conclude that enforcers and
   courts should use a multiple-markets approach in which different groups
   of users on different sides of a platform belong in different product
   markets. This approach appropriately accounts for cross-market network
   effects without collapsing all of a platform's users into a single
   product market. Furthermore, we advocate the use of a separate-effects
   analysis, which rejects the view that anticompetitive conduct harming
   users on one side of a platform can be justified so long as that harm
   funds benefits for users on another side. Courts should consider the
   price structure of a platform, and not simply the net price, in
   assessing competitive effects. This approach in turn supports our final
   conclusion: that antitrust plaintiffs should not be required to prove as
   part of their prima facie case more than occurrence of competitive harm
   in a properly-defined market; thereafter, the burden to produce
   procompetitive justifications should shift to defendants.},

Abstract = {The strong growth of different types of online video-on-demand (VoD), ie
   nonlinear audiovisual media services, including both Paid-for VoD like
   Amazon Prime and Netflix and Advertised-financed VoD like YouTube
   increasingly challenges the leading position of ``traditional{''}
   (terrestrial, cable, satellite) television, ie linear audiovisual media
   services. Competition policy decisions in such dynamic markets are
   always particularly challenging. The German competition authority was
   presented such a challenge when, at the beginning of the 2010s, German
   television providers sought to enter online VoD markets with the help of
   cooperative portals. We review the antitrust concerns that were raised
   back then in an ex post analysis. We derive four aspects, in which the
   previous antitrust analysis cannot be upheld from today's perspective.
   First, relevant implications of modern platform economics were
   neglected. Secondly, some inconsistencies in the assessment of the two
   projects appear to be inappropriate. Thirdly, the emerging competitive
   pressure of international VoD providers was strongly underestimated.
   Fourthly, the question of market power in online advertising markets
   looks very different at the end of the decade.},

Abstract = {In policy circles of Washington DC, in academia, and among advocates and
   lobbyists, there has been growing attention to the role of antitrust
   enforcement versus regulation in today's economy (see, e.g., Shapiro in
   Int J Ind Organ 61:714-748, 2017). Various populist arguments seek an
   expanded role for antitrust law, as proponents seek to control the
   perceived political and free speech dangers associated with market
   concentration. These new populists are particularly interested in large,
   content-laden companies such as Google, Facebook, and broadcast and
   cable firms. Strong interest in content companies is, of course, not
   new. This essay explores different political, economic, and
   philosophical regimes at play when the United States chose to enact the
   Radio Act of 1927 and regulate, rather than leave to antitrust controls,
   the emerging radio industry. By examining antitrust at the dawn of the
   Radio Act of 1927, there are lessons to be learned for the political
   treatment of today's social media, broadcast, cable, and
   telecommunications industry. In particular the story of the Radio Act of
   1927 highlights two historically recurring political themes: (1) a
   longstanding, near-universal political goal to control content and (2)
   the tension between selecting an ex post antitrust enforcement regime
   versus an ex ante regulatory regime to control economic concentration
   and power. It is this second theme that is primarily explored here.},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the development of 5G are
   set to add a new layer of complexity to the current practice of standard
   essential patents (SEPs) licensing. While, until recently, the debate
   has centred on the nature of fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory
   (FRAND) commitments and the mechanisms to avoid hold-up and reverse
   hold-up problems between licensors and licensees, a new hotly-debated
   issue has now emerged. At its core is the question of whether SEP
   holders should be required to grant a FRAND licence to any implementer
   seeking a licence, including component makers (the so-called
   `licence-to-all' approach), or if they should be allowed freely to
   target the supply-chain level at which the licence is to be granted (the
   so-called `access-for-all' approach). After providing an up-to-date
   overview of the current legal and economic debate, this article focuses
   on the most recent antitrust case law dealing with the matter on both
   sides of the Atlantic and argues that no sound economic and legal bases
   which favour licence-to-all solutions can be identified.},

Abstract = {The implications of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement for
   promoting innovation and growth in the Digital Economy of the
   Asia-Pacific Region are examined. The Treaty is the first multilateral
   agreement to specifically take up economic and trade issues related to
   the Internet and includes ground-breaking provisions with respect to
   online privacy, cybersecurity, promotion of cross-border data flows and
   competition policy. These are being closely examined by non-parties to
   the agreement, such as Indonesia, China and India and could evolve into
   a defacto framework for the regional Digital Economy. TPP may not be
   sufficient to deal with challenges to greater regional cooperation on
   issues such as the still growing ``digital divide{''} and persistent
   security tensions in the region, but its success could evidence the
   utility of relying on trade-based mechansims to address isssues
   associatd with regional Internet governance within a well-established
   and understood multilateral framework.},

Abstract = {Google Search and its algorithm have been subject to intense antitrust
   scrutiny from competition authorities both in the United States and
   around the world. Google's introduction of Universal Search in 2007
   integrated specialized search results within a narrow category (for
   example, shopping or local businesses) with its customary ``blue
   links.{''} This integration led to objections that Google was engaging
   in ``search bias,{''} and thus foreclosing specialized search rivals to
   the detriment of competition and consumers. In this paper, we describe
   the precise nature of the anticompetitive claims against Google and
   develop an economic framework and empirical test to assess these claims.
   We rely upon our economic framework to offer insights for competition
   authorities to consider for future cases involving platforms and
   allegations of foreclosure and exclusion.},

Title = {Rebalancing Competition Policy to Stimulate Innovation and Sustain
   Growth},
Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Innovation is fundamental to sustainable economic development because
   input resources are finite. When an economy faces constraints such as
   land and labour, innovation fuels continued growth through new
   technologies that utilises the limited resources more productively.
   Competition contributes to this process by providing a platform for new
   technologies to replace old ones, but excessive competition may also
   dampen the incentives to innovate. Unlike economics literature which
   typically examines how market structure affects innovation, this paper
   explores how innovation affects the market structure. We observe that,
   as innovative businesses are scalable, markets are becoming more
   concentrated from a static point of view. However, as disruptive
   innovation takes place in the broader ecosystem of separate but related
   markets, product life cycles shorten, and these concentrated markets
   become more competitive from a dynamic point of view. We also find that
   innovative products often do not conform to existing regulations. In
   order to unleash the full potential of innovation as a driving force for
   sustained economic growth, we recommend a rebalancing of competition law
   and policy towards stronger enforcement against lateral anti-competitive
   activities versus horizontal and vertical ones. We also recommend more
   emphasis on dynamic competition analysis versus static ones in
   regulatory decision-making.},

Abstract = {Recent calls for using the antitrust laws to break up the large Internet
   giants are misplaced for a number of reasons. First, similar efforts
   against oil, tobacco, motion-picture, and telecommunications monopolies
   have not proved to be beneficial to economic welfare. Second, the
   failure to break up Microsoft using Section2 has not proved to be a
   mistake: competition in operating systems and Internet browsers has
   flourished recently. Finally, a Section2 case against Amazon, Facebook,
   or Google could not succeed if it focused on the digital advertising
   market. Even in a case based on market power on the other side of their
   platforms, a structural remedya break-upwould not improve economic
   welfare in the long run.},

Title = {DOES COMPETITION ENFORCEMENT PREVENT COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES OF DIGITAL

Journal = {ROSSIISKII ZHURNAL MENEDZHMENTA-RUSSIAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},

Pages = {547-568},
Abstract = {Competitive strategies of platforms often involve contractual
   arrangements that might be considered as anticompetitive. Since recent
   decisions of European Commission after investigations against Google in
   2017 and 2018, and Bundeskartellamt against Facebook in 2019, the
   standards of liability for abuses applied by competition authorities
   will influence business models of digital platforms. This paper
   summarizes theories of harm applied by BRICS competition authorities
   applied towards multi-sided platforms under investigations. One may
   expect that BRICS approach to be harsher compared to mature competition
   jurisdictions. However, a comparison shows that discrimination and tying
   with exclusionary effects have been the focus of investigations and
   decisions in BRICS. Remedies in the infringement decisions are intended
   to protect rivalry through ``no restriction of multihoming{''}
   conditions. There is no evidence that BRICS authorities apply a specific
   economic theory of multi-sided platforms. At the same time, BRICS
   competition enforcement could be applied as one of the legal instruments
   when one platform tries to crowd out another from global markets.},

Abstract = {Financial technology (Fintech) has been applied to business models in
   the financial services sector. Associated with this has been the rise of
   regulatory technology (Regtech) in that sector. However, the major
   application of Regtech in financial services is as a tool for regulatory
   compliance, rather than for regulatory enforcement. This article
   explores an approach to applying Regtech techniques to antitrust
   enforcement. It does this by applying those techniques to the detection
   of resale price maintenance (vertical price fixing). The exploration is
   limited to pricing on e-commerce platforms such as AliExpress, eBay, and
   Amazon Marketplace. The Regtech application is effected by presenting
   the literature and cases on resale price maintenance and the application
   of the law in Australia, the US, and the EU. The article examines the
   application of machine learning in the Regtech environment and the ways
   in which application programming interfaces could be used. The article
   proposes approaches to machine learning solutions for the detection of
   potentially infringing resale price maintenance conduct. It also
   presents the basis of an algorithm for detecting that conduct.},

Abstract = {This article undertakes a critical review of the prospect that
   reinforced-learning, or more loosely described machine-based, pricing
   algorithms will lead to widespread collusion without human involvement.
   There is no evidence, no antitrust case, and no strong theoretical and
   practical reasons for this belief. Notwithstanding this dearth of
   evidence, legal commentators continue to insist that algorithmic
   collusion poses a significant threat and that there is a ``gap{''} in
   antitrust laws that needs to be filled. However, a reasonable assessment
   suggests that EU antitrust law and its enforcement are adaptable enough
   to deal with the cases that may arise.},

   needs to be replaced or revised in order for antitrust law to deal

   the economic concerns that critics have raised, and that the proposed

Abstract = {The German Facebook case has directly addressed the contentious
   interplay between data protection and competition law for the first
   time. The Bundeskartellamt's theory of harm, which directly linked
   privacy violations to the strengthening of Facebook's market power,
   proved controversial: it elicited strong criticism from the appeals
   court, but then was partially endorsed by the Bundesgerichtshof (German
   Federal Supreme Court). This article shows that an enforcement action
   against Facebook under Article 102 TFEU need not be controversial. We
   present empirical evidence confirming that Facebook's `envelopment by
   privacy policy tying' strategy exploits consumers, as it causes clear
   consumer harm on the market for social networks in the form of lack of
   choice and degradation of quality. In turn, such consumer harm on the
   `free' side leads to a weakening of the competitive market structure and
   foreclosure of competitors on the `paid' market for display advertising
   and other adjacent markets. This strategy falls neatly within the scope
   of Article 102 TFEU, irrespective of whether it also violates EU data
   protection law. In addition, the enveloping by privacy policy tying
   forms part of an overall anti-competitive strategy over which the
   Commission can assert jurisdiction and prosecute as a single and
   continuous infringement.},

Journal = {COMPETITION POLICY INTERNATIONAL},

Number = {2},
Pages = {71-85},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Software platforms anchor vast global communities of users, application
   developers, device manufacturers, content providers, advertisers, and
   others. They drive innovation by enabling entrepreneurs, often anywhere
   in the world, to develop ``applications{''} and to reach all the users
   of the platform, often anywhere in the world. These applications are
   sometimes the foundation of substantial businesses. The value of these
   software platforms, and their ability to support large communities,
   depend on the ability of the platform to promote positive externalities
   and reduce negative externalities. Software platforms usually impose
   rules and standards and often exclude participants that harm others in
   the community, and reward participants that benefit others in the
   community. Competition policy should presume that these governance
   systems, and the restrictions they place on platform
   participants-including their possible expulsion from the platform-are
   efficient and pro-competitive. Software platforms could, however, employ
   governance systems to foreclose competition. These restrictions,
   therefore, should not be lawful per se. Rather, courts and competition
   authorities should employ screens to protect pro-competitive
   restrictions and isolate anticompetitive ones. The application of these
   screens should be neutral to the licensing model chosen by the software
   platform creator. There is, in particular, no basis for imposing
   limitations that are, in effect, tougher on software platforms that use
   an open-source license model than on software platforms that use a
   proprietary license.},

Journal = {POLICY AND INTERNET},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {28-46},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A key concern in international policy debates about articulating
   oversight of digital platform markets involves policy silos, arising
   from the scope of platformization and datafication, and the challenges
   in defining their policy boundaries and coordinating a comprehensive
   policy response. This article examines how policymakers grapple with the
   problem by looking at a growing number of expert inquiries on digital
   platforms-a proxy for the international policy debate-that focus on
   policy problems ranging from market dominance and privacy risks to the
   spread of disinformation. Specifically, the article develops a schema of
   related policy silos and tradeoffs that arise in these debates: (1)
   policy area silos, (2) market/sectoral silos, (3) temporal silos, and
   (4) normative tradeoffs. Then, it critically examines the implications
   of these silos and tradeoffs for policy interventions aimed at
   addressing concerns related to datafication and platformization, raising
   key questions about the scope of and assumptions underlying platform
   regulation internationally and noting the way they constrain policy
   design and thwart more holistic policy solutions.},

Title = {The Law and Economics of Tying in Digital Platforms: Comparing Tencent
   and Android},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW \& ECONOMICS},
Abstract = {Tying has become a common practice in digital platforms. It may generate
   both pro-competitive effects and anti-competitive effects, which makes
   it difficult to distinguish between lawful and unlawful tying practices.
   The cases of Tencent and Android both involve tying conducts, but
   interestingly, the cases have different outcomes. This article explores
   reasons for these different case outcomes from a comparative law and
   economics perspective. By assessing the facts and legal rulings in
   Tencent and Android, we find that the different case outcomes result, on
   the one hand, from the different case facts, and on the other hand, from
   the different approaches used by the EU Commission and the Chinese
   Supreme People's Court. The Court scores better in terms of ensuring
   legal certainty; nevertheless, it may face difficulties when it has to
   apply economic analysis. The Commission seemingly uses more economics,
   but the application is not full-fledged, as it disregards important case
   facts when assessing competition foreclosure, and employs asymmetric
   legal tests and evidence standards for anti/pro-competitive effects of
   tying. From a law and economics perspective, we provide suggestions for
   China and the EU, taking the recent Anti-Monopoly Guidelines on
   Platforms in China and the forthcoming Digital Markets Act in the EU
   into account.},

Abstract = {Google has been accused of manipulating its organic search results to
   favor its own services. We explore possible choices of relevant
   antitrust markets that might make these various antitrust allegations
   meaningful. We argue that viewing Internet search in isolation ignores
   the two-sided nature of the search-advertising platform and the feedback
   effects that link the provision of organic search results to consumers
   on the one hand, and the sale to businesses of advertising on the other.
   We conclude that the relevant market in which Google competes with
   respect to Internet search is at least as broad as a two-sided
   search-advertising market. We also ask whether Google has a duty to
   provide organic search results that are neutral with respect to whether
   the displayed listing is for a Google rather than a non-Google business.
   We articulate and apply a standard that asks whether various practices
   related to Google's organic search results would harm competition that
   would have otherwise occurred.},

Title = {The Google-DoubleClick Merger: Lessons From the Federal Trade
   Commission's Limitations on Protecting Privacy},

Abstract = {In the wake of Big Tech's growing power, much attention has been
   directed to the Federal Trade Commission as the regulatory force for
   monitoring the technology industry. But scholars are largely divided on
   the issue of whether privacy exists within the scope of antitrust law.
   Using the 2008 acquisition of DoubleClick by Google as a case study,
   this article argues that privacy is an antitrust issue and should have
   been considered in the FTC's merger review process for the ways it
   affected both competition and consumer welfare. The article examines the
   role of consumer data in fortifying Google's barriers to entry,
   squashing innovation, and reducing choice in the marketplace, and
   considers the invasion of data privacy as an issue of consumer
   protection. The article argues that the foundation for evaluating
   privacy within the merger review already exists, as Section 5 of the FTC
   Act gives the Commission special responsibility to uphold these values
   and interpret its review process in order to keep up with a changing
   market structure. More than a decade later, these lessons remain
   relevant, as antitrust law experiences a resurgence in the United
   States.},

Abstract = {The 1965 legislation to curb restrictive trade practices has been widely
   regarded as weak. By contrast, the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) has
   been considered as providing the platform for a more comprehensive
   competition policy. This paper argues that the 1965-67 and 1971 Acts
   were more effective than has been commonly recognised in raising
   awareness about the extent of restrictive trade practices, discrediting
   price agreements and laying the foundations for the 1974 Act. The role
   of Ron Bannerman, the sole Commissioner of Trade Practices, was critical
   to their success. This paper uses parliamentary debates, Bannerman's
   published works and an interview with him undertaken in early 2005.},

Journal = {DIGITAL INVESTIGATION},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Co-operation and education are fundamental issues when dealing with
   national and international organizations involved in digital forensic
   investigations. Although these two aspects are often separately handled,
   they are strictly connected. On the one hand, different agencies can
   leverage on co-operation for the training of their investigators while,
   on the other hand, co-operation is possible only if an adequate level of
   education on digital forensic matters is reached. In this paper, the
   concrete outcome of a complete training program that involved several
   European antitrust agencies is reported (named EAT\_FIT, European
   Antitrust Training in Forensic IT). We sum up the activities and the
   techniques that are generally used in antitrust investigations, and we
   outline the rationales used to set up such a training course. Assessment
   data collected both during and after the training highlight the needs
   and the difficulties faced by the digital forensic practitioners working
   in the field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Some digital business models may be so innovative that they overwhelm
   existing regulatory mechanisms, both legislation and historical
   jurisprudence, and require extension to or modification of antitrust
   law. Regulatory policies that were developed in response to nineteenth-
   or twentieth-century antitrust concerns dealt principally with economies
   of scale leading to monopoly power and may not be well suited to the
   issues of network effects or third-party payer online business models
   such as sponsored search. From the perspective of information systems
   economics, we investigate if such third-party payer digital systems
   require intervention as profound as the government's innovative approach
   to the problems posed by AT\&T in the 1913 Kingsbury Commitment,
   establishing the first private regulated monopoly. Google provides an
   example of a company whose innovative digital business model is
   difficult to fit into current regulatory frameworks, and may provide
   examples of the issues that might require an extension to regulatory
   policy.},

Abstract = {The article presents three case studies relating to multisided markets
   which were handled by the Swedish Competition Authority (SCA). These
   include the market for online booking of hotel rooms, the market for
   online listings of properties, and the market for online orders of take
   away food. The case studies show how an analysis based on the more
   recently developed economic theory on platform markets allows for a
   successful application of existing competition law. Moreover, common
   predictions on the economic behaviour of platform markets, as can be
   found in the academic literature, are tested against the experiences
   drawn from the aforementioned investigations. In addition to providing a
   robustness check on common assertions made on the functioning of
   platform markets, the article seeks to contribute to a better
   understanding of such markets by adding to the debate on when these
   common assertions are likely to hold.},

Abstract = {Challenging anticompetitive acquisitions of nascent competitors is a top
   priority of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. It
   is especially important that competition agencies remain vigilant of
   such acquisitions in platform markets, where indirect network effects
   and other market forces tend to preserve the status quo at the expense
   of smaller, more innovative rivals and potentially final consumers. This
   article discusses two such attempted acquisitions: (1) Visa's
   acquisition of technology firm Plaid that threatened to disrupt Visa's
   monopoly power in online debit; and (2) Sabre's acquisition of
   Farelogix, which is a firm that allows airlines to connect directly to
   travel agencies and thereby disintermediates Sabre and other global
   distribution systems.},

Abstract = {One hot topic is whether Google has violated the antitrust laws. Another
   important topic is how behavioral economics can enrich antitrust policy.
   This article examines two implications of behavioral economics on
   antitrust monopolization law.The article first discusses trial-and-error
   learning as an entry barrier. This is timely given the current debate
   over the entry barriers of the search engine market. The article next
   discusses behavioral exploitation to maintain a monopoly. The behavioral
   economics literature can help explain the European Commissions tying
   claims against Microsoft, why the Commissions original remedy failed,
   and the benefits and risks of the Commissions remedy involving its
   subsequent prosecution of Microsoft over Internet browsers.},

Abstract = {``Zero-price markets,{''} wherein firms set the price of their goods or
   services at \$o, have exploded in quantity and variety. Creative
   content, software, search functions, social media platforms, mobile
   applications, travel booking, navigation and mapping systems, and myriad
   other goods and services are now widely distributed at zero prices. But
   despite the exponential increase in the volume of zero-price products
   being consumed, antitrust institutions and analysts have failed to
   provide an adequate response to markets without prices.
   Modern antitrust law is firmly grounded in neoclassical economics, which
   is in turn centered on price theory. Steeped in price theory, preeminent
   antitrust theorists have urged that without prices there can be no
   markets, and consequently no market power. This heavy methodological
   dependence on positive prices has led antitrust courts and enforcement
   agencies to overlook potentially massive welfare harms. Unfortunately,
   recent empirical research confirms that such harms have already
   occurred.
   These failures to conceive of zero-price markets as antitrust
   ``markets{''} indicate how fundamentally zero prices challenge
   traditional theories and analytical frameworks.
   This Article establishes a novel taxonomy of customer-facing costs,
   distinguishing ``market-signaling{''} from ``non-market-signaling{''}
   costs. Crucially, it demonstrates that market-signaling costs are
   present in many zero-price contexts. The absence of positive prices thus
   does not foreclose antitrust scrutiny; ``trade,{''} for purposes of the
   Sherman and Clayton Acts, encompasses zero-price transactions. To
   continue ignoring welfare harms in these markets would be both unjust
   and inefficient. The Article concludes by identifying antitrust law's
   proper role within and stance toward zero-price markets.},

Abstract = {Pricing decisions are increasingly in the hands of artificial
   algorithms. Scholars and competition authorities have voiced concerns
   that those algorithms are capable of sustaining collusive outcomes more
   effectively than can human decision makers. If this is so, then our
   traditional policy tools for fighting collusion may have to be
   reconsidered. We discuss these issues by critically surveying the
   relevant law, economics, and computer science literature.},

Abstract = {The European Union's (EU) 2018 Audiovisual Media Services Directive
   attempted to level the playing field upon which video sharing platforms
   and audiovisual media services compete by evening out advertising and
   consumer protection rules. Recent competition policy, literature
   identifies data as a source of dominance in platform markets, suggesting
   its relevance to such situations where platforms compete with other
   services. Drawing on a study of this playing field involving stakeholder
   interviews and a comparison of regulatory frameworks, we present a
   nuanced understanding of imbalances across three distinct functions of
   data. We consider the policy implications, arguing fix more equitable
   access to insight from aggregate, anonymized data and financial data.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with collusive risks that can result from the
   ecosystems created by digital platforms. Recent case reports reflect
   that the potential for harm and benefit can be tightly interwoven here.
   It is not entirely clear, however, in what way the creation of a
   platform can, in itself, amount to a breach of the cartel prohibition,
   and how the potential for harm can be balanced against efficiencies in
   those cases. I argue in favour of an integrated construal of conduct and
   effect in order to close regulatory gaps whilst preventing false
   positives.},

Title = {Abusive pricing practices by online platforms: a framework review of
   Article 102 TFEU for future cases},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT},
Abstract = {The challenges involved in the application of Article 102 TFEU to online
   platforms have become the main topic of debate in the context of EU
   competition policy in digital markets. This debate has recently also
   extended to the topic of platform pricing with the complaints about the
   pricing strategies of Apple with respect to its App Store and it is a
   matter of time before similar complaints will follow with respect to
   other prominent platforms. Applying the current framework of price
   related abuses under Article 102 TFEU to the pricing practices of online
   platforms will, however, require adapting the respective legal tests of
   abuse to the commercial reality of these actors. Doing so will
   inevitably entail accounting for their multisided nature which would
   sometimes require that the assessments of abuse extend to more than one
   side of the platform. Furthermore, such legal assessments would also
   have to consider the special role played by platform pricing as a
   coordination tool for getting multiple types of customer groups on board
   with the aim of facilitating profitable interactions between them.
   Therefore, this article seeks to explore how the current frameworks for
   price-related abuses could be applied and, if needed, adapted so as to
   fit the commercial reality of online platforms. The aim of this effort
   is to provide guidance for ongoing and future cases so as to prevent
   legitimate pricing practices from being erroneously scrutinized as well
   as to prevent anti-competitive pricing practices from escaping legal
   scrutiny due to the intricacies of platform pricing schemes.},

   broad responses to the advent of `big tech'; namely, a return to the
   `structure, conduct and performance' analyses of market power
   characteristic of the mid-century Harvard School, and a newly
   uncompromising application of the Chicago School's emphasis on
   price-based consumer welfare and allocative efficiency. In Australia, as
   in the United States, both responses have antecedents in extant
   competition law and policy and each is broadly conceivable as a response
   to concerns about stalled reforms and stagnant productivity growth. This
   essay examines each incipient response to the rise of the `tech titans'
   and explores the futures each response anticipates for Australian
   competition law and policy.},

Abstract = {Multisided platforms have distinct and critical features that set them
   apart from single-sided markets. This realization has led to a split
   among courts, antitrust practitioners, and economists as to the best
   method to assess whether mergers or conduct that involve platforms
   result in the creation or maintenance of monopoly power and violate the
   antitrust laws. Some argue that each side of a platform constitutes a
   separate relevant product market. Others argue for a single, integrated
   market that incorporates all sides. We argue that any prima facie
   antitrust assessment of competitive harm must incorporate the impact to
   consumers on all sides regardless of market definition. We also explain
   why output effects should be the primary emphasis of competitive effects
   analyses. The Supreme Court recently and correctly adopted this approach
   in Ohio v. American Express.},

Abstract = {For the past few decades, competition authorities around the world have
   said they seek to promote consumer welfare. However, in recent years,
   several national competition authorities have announced major
   investigations into behavior by digital platforms-including some
   behavior that does not immediately harm downstream consumers. This has
   reopened old questions about the fundamental purpose of competition law:
   What is the harm that competition law is designed to address? How,
   exactly, does competition law promote economic welfare? Separately, the
   literature on ecosystems emphasizes the central role of non-generic
   complementary investments as a defining feature of ecosystems and the
   power this can give to ecosystem orchestrators over their associated
   complementors. We draw these strands together to show how a recently
   proposed economic foundation for competition law, drawing on the
   transactions cost literature, provides a consistent, compelling, and
   economically sound foundation for competition policy toward digital
   platforms going forward.},

Abstract = {Under the ``One Country, Two Systems{''} rule, Hong Kong and China
   maintain different legal systems. This dichotomy also applies in the
   antitrust context. China adopted its Anti-Monopoly Law in 2007, while
   Hong Kong waited until 2012 to introduce its Competition Ordinance (and
   another three years to fully implement it). This article compares the
   antitrust laws of these two jurisdictions and their enforcement in light
   of a turning point: the disruption caused by Big Tech. Interestingly,
   while the competition laws of Hong Kong and China are substantively
   similar to each other and to legal precedent in other jurisdictions,
   Hong Kong has adopted an adversarial system of enforcement, and China an
   administrative system. Through an analysis of recent antitrust
   developments in the two jurisdictions, this article shows the importance
   of agency independence, due process, and robust judicial scrutiny for
   the proper functioning of an administrative system of enforcement. This
   article also demonstrates that judicial scrutiny in an adversarial
   system needs the certainty of legal rules, particularly to clarify the
   burden of proof to be met by the competition authorities. In light of
   these findings, this article proposes a three-pronged competition and
   regulation approach for the scrutiny of Big Tech that does not water
   down the two principles of due process and robust judicial scrutiny.
   This is significant. The frustration with market concentration should
   not lead policymakers to propose changes to antitrust enforcement that
   could weaken these two principles and attribute a higher value to the
   speed of decision-making over the importance of a thorough analysis.},

Abstract = {Should internet era merger policy differ from industrial era merger
   policy? Platform ecosystems rely on economies of scale, data-driven
   economies of scope, high-quality algorithmic systems, and strong network
   effects that frequently promote winner-take-most markets. Their market
   dominance has generated competition concerns that appear difficult to
   assess with traditional merger policy tools. This paper examines the
   acquisition strategies of the five major U.S. platforms-Google, Amazon,
   Facebook, Apple, and Microsoftsince their inception. We discuss the main
   merger and acquisition theories of harm and how these operate
   differently than in the past. To address merger and acquisition concerns
   of multi-sided platforms, we develop four proposals that incorporate (i)
   a new ex ante regulatory framework, (ii) an update of the conditions
   under which the notification of mergers should be compulsory and the
   burden of proof should be reversed, (iii) differential regulatory
   priorities in investigating horizontal versus vertical acquisitions, and
   (iv) an update of competition enforcement tools to increase visibility
   into market data and trends.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Amazon is the titan of twenty-first century commerce. In addition to
   being a retailer, it is now a marketing platform, a delivery and
   logistics network, a payment service, a credit lender, an auction house,
   a major book publisher, a producer of television and films, a fashion
   designer, a hardware manufacturer, and a leading host of cloud server
   space. Although Amazon has clocked staggering growth, it generates
   meager profits, choosing to price below-cost and expand widely instead
   Through this strategy, the company has positioned itself at the center
   of e-commerce and now serves as essential infrastructure for a host of
   other businesses that depend upon it. Elements of the firm's structure
   and conduct pose anticompetitive concerns yet it has escaped antitrust
   scrutiny.
   This Note argues that the current framework in antitrust specifically
   its pegging competition to ``consumer welfare,{''} defined as short-term
   price effects is unequipped to capture the architecture of market power
   in the modern economy. We cannot cognize the potential harms to
   competition posed by Amazon's dominance if we measure competition
   primarily through price and output. Specifically, current doctrine
   underappreciates the risk of predatory pricing and how integration
   across distinct business lines may prove anticompetitive. These concerns
   are heightened in the context of online platforms for two reasons.
   First, the economics of platform markets create incentives for a company
   to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded.
   Under these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational even
   as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.
   Second, because online platforms serve as critical intermediaries,
   integrating across business lines positions these platforms to control
   the essential infrastructure on which their rivals depend. This dual
   role also enables a platform to exploit information collected on
   companies using its services to undermine them as competitors.
   This Note maps out facets of Amazon's dominance. Doing so enables us to
   make sense of its business strategy, illuminates anticompetitive aspects
   of Amazon's structure and conduct, and underscores deficiencies in
   current doctrine. The Note closes by considering two potential regimes
   for addressing Amazon's power: restoring traditional antitrust and
   competition policy principles or applying common carrier obligations and
   duties.},

Abstract = {The technological developments of recent decades have allowed companies
   to collect staggering amounts of consumer data by offering ``free{''}
   access to digital products like search engines and social-media
   platforms. Scholars in a variety of fields recognize that this practice
   represents a new type of market exchange, but our tax laws and tax
   scholars have thus far ignored this aspect of the new economy. That
   inattention means that transactions in data currently benefit from an
   implicit exemption from tax. This Article brings light to that issue by
   providing the first analysis of the relationship between the
   personal-data market and our domestic tax instruments. That analysis
   shows that personal-data transactions do fit within those tax
   instruments, but that several factors will prevent them from actually
   being taxed. The resulting tax preference for data creates a distortion
   in the market that results in lost tax revenue and that undermines
   efforts to reform the personal-data market to better account for
   individual privacy interests. This Article considers those issues and
   concludes by urging the recognition of the tax preference for data in
   the broader U.S. regulatory structure related to data and personal
   privacy.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology and network
   economy, innovative competition mode and profit mode come forth
   continuously. Website ranking service is a kind of pay-per-click (PPC)
   advertising offered by online search engine operators and is a new
   profit mode for e-marketing in the network economy era. It brings
   service providers much more profits. However, there are concerns that
   such website ranking service will create a space of commercial fraud and
   unfair competition, more and more corporations will be kidnapped by this
   marketing mode because of the market dominant position of Baidu.com in
   the Chinese search engine service industry. Therefore, lack of legal
   risk management for the search engine companies in this field has made
   the website ranking service a significant source of disputes. This
   article explores the legal problems arising from website ranking service
   by taking Baidu.com as a case, and discusses Internet service providers'
   legal liability under Chinese newly enforced Antitrust Law mainly. Then,
   this article tries to analyze other potential legal risks of Internet
   business under AML as an extensive thought from the discussion
   beforehand. Finally, this article puts forward some resolutions aiming
   at protecting the fair and efficient competition environment as well as
   the rights and interests of all parties.},

Abstract = {What is the current vitality of antitrust enforcement? Antitrust class
   actions-the primary mode of competition oversight-has weathered two
   decades of procedural reform. This Article documents the effects of
   those reforms. Relying on an original dataset of over 1300 antitrust
   class action settlements, this Article finds such cases alive but far
   from well. Certain suits do succeed on an impressive scale, returning
   billions of dollars to victims. But class action reform has made
   antitrust enforcement narrower, more time-consuming, and costlier than
   only a decade ago. And, as this Article's sources reveal, new battle
   lines are forming. Across the political spectrum, people are trumpeting
   antitrust as the next great hope to resolve trade issues, equalize
   wealth inequity, and reform Big Tech. Even amid these rising calls,
   class action opponents continue to campaign for more reform. This
   Article describes those efforts and provides the essential data to repel
   them.},

Title = {Effects of restricting social media usage on wellbeing and performance:
   A randomized control trial among students},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Recent research has shown that social media services create large
   consumer surplus. Despite their positive impact on economic welfare,
   concerns are raised about the negative association between social media
   usage and well-being or performance. However, causal empirical evidence
   is still scarce. To address this research gap, we conduct a randomized
   controlled trial among students in which we track participants' daily
   digital activities over the course of three quarters of an academic
   year. In the experiment, we randomly allocate half of the sample to a
   treatment condition in which social media usage (Facebook, Instagram,
   and Snapchat) is restricted to a maximum of 10 minutes per day. We find
   that participants in the treatment group substitute social media for
   instant messaging and do not decrease their total time spent on digital
   devices. Contrary to findings from previous correlational studies, we do
   not find any significant impact of social media usage as it was defined
   in our study on well-being and academic success. Our results also
   suggest that antitrust authorities should consider instant messaging and
   social media services as direct competitors before approving
   acquisitions.},

Abstract = {Digital transformation has led to changes in business models of
   traditional players in the existing markets. What is more, new entrants
   and new markets appeared, in particular platforms and multisided
   markets. The emergence and rapid development of platforms are caused
   primarily by the existence of so called indirect network externalities.
   Regarding to this, a question arises of whether the existing instruments
   of competition law enforcement and market analysis are still relevant
   when analyzing markets with digital platforms? This paper aims at
   discussing advantages and disadvantages of using various tools to define
   markets with platforms. In particular, we define the features of the
   SSNIP test when being applyed to markets with platforms. Furthermore, we
   analyze adjustment in tests for platform market definition in terms of
   possible type I and type II errors. All in all, it turns out that to
   reduce the likelihood of type I and type II errors while applying market
   definition technique to markets with platforms one should consider the
   type of platform analyzed: transaction platforms without pass-through
   and non-transaction matching platforms should be tackled as players in a
   multisided market, whereas non-transaction platforms should be analyzed
   as players in several interrelated markets. However, if the platform is
   allowed to adjust prices, there emerges additional challenge that the
   regulator and companies may manipulate the results of SSNIP test by
   applying different models of competition.},

Abstract = {We analyze the competition issues in mobile money in Kenya-where
   Safaricom is the market leader-and in Uganda: where the market is
   duopolistic. We evaluate the multi-sided platform characteristics that
   have underpinned the rapid growth of the lead mobile money platforms and
   that also imply that the market leaders have substantial market power
   and can act as gatekeepers. The conduct of the lead firms is assessed
   along with competition measures and regulatory interventions made in
   each country. The analysis highlights the importance of-and challenges
   for-competition enforcement in developing countries to ensure effective
   rivalry while realizing the gains from innovation in digital platforms.},

Abstract = {Thanks to the rapid advance in technology, the arrival of artificial
   intelligence, and easy digital connectivity across nations, the ground
   beneath the global economy is shifting. This has given rise to new
   social and political problems and challenges for market capitalism. The
   paper argues the need for original work in economic theory to capture
   and understand the essence of markets in this new, digital age; and goes
   on to speculate about what shape this may take. The paper discusses the
   need to think out of the box in terms of economic policy, arguing that
   the reach of antitrust law is inadequate for our digital-platform-based
   economy, and we have to think of new forms of regulation.},

Title = {Analysis of current penalty schemes for violations of antitrust laws},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPTIMIZATION THEORY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {128},
Number = {2},
Pages = {431-451},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The main feature of the penalty schemes described in current sentencing
   guidelines is that the fine is based on the accumulated gains from
   cartel activities or price-fixing activities for the firm. The
   regulations suggest modeling the penalty as an increasing function of
   the accumulated illegal gains from price fixing to the firm, so that the
   history of the violation is taken into account. We incorporate these
   features of the penalty scheme into an optimal control model of a
   profit-maximizing firm under antitrust enforcement. To determine the
   effect of taking into account the history of the violation, we compare
   the outcome of this model with a model where the penalty is fixed. The
   analysis of the latter model implies that complete deterrence can be
   achieved only at the cost of shutting down the firm. The proportional
   scheme improves upon the fixed penalty, since it can ensure complete
   deterrence in the long run, even when penalties are moderate.
   Phase-diagram analysis shows that, the higher the probability and
   severity of punishment, the sooner cartel formation is blocked. Further,
   a sensitivity analysis is provided to show which strategies are most
   successful in reducing the degree of price fixing. It turns out that,
   when the penalties are already high, the antitrust policy aiming at a
   further increase in the severity of punishment is less efficient than
   the policy that increases the probability of punishment.},

   describe the work on price gouging conducted by the CMA's Covid-19
   taskforce and respond to the argument that competition authorities
   should not be concerned about such behaviour. Second, a number of
   high-profile studies have considered the appropriate application of
   competition policy in digital industries. The second two cases-the
   Online Platforms and Digital Advertising market study, and the
   Google/Looker merger-show the work the CMA has continued to do in this

Title = {Designing Remedies for Digital Markets: The Interplay Between Antitrust
   and Regulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Regulatory interventions aimed at promoting competition in digital
   markets face a challenge: How to design remedies that actually improve
   welfare? This article helps provide an answer to this question. First,
   it maps out the frontier of remedy design: Part II.A summarizes
   antitrust and regulatory remedies imposed on digital companies over the
   past decades, while Part II.B reviews nineteen reports on competition in
   digital markets to identify proposals to advance antitrust or regulatory
   interventions. Part III, the core of the article, builds on this review
   to propose a new, two-level framework for remedy design that integrates
   pro-competition antitrust and regulatory interventions as part of a
   single policy. First, at the substantive level, it develops a compounded
   error-cost framework that helps authorities to choose between different
   remedies applicableto a given conduct: when policymakers accept higher
   risks of over-enforcement in deciding to intervene, they should
   compensate by taking lower risks of over-enforcement in remedy design
   and vice-versa. Second, at the institutional level, the article proposes
   that authorities consider separating three connected but different key
   activities in remedy design: (i) identifying harmful behavior, (ii)
   designing interventions, and (iii) monitoring and adapting remedies. It
   also outlines four criteria (legal mandate, need for technical
   expertise, relative risks of regulatory capture, and overall
   administrative costs) that can help authorities allocate these tasks
   among different regulators. Part IV concludes by applying this framework
   to seven types of conduct that Part II identified as potentially
   problematic: (i) discrimination, unfair treatment, and
   self-preferencing; (ii) exclusivity contracts; (iii) tying or bundling;
   (iv) MFNs and other price parity clauses; (v) refusals to deal, limited
   interoperability, and lack of data portability; (vi) exploitative or
   exclusionary terms of service; and (vii) nudges, sludges, and other
   concerns around user interfaces.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of online search and its centrality to the ecology of
   the Internet pose important questions: why is the search engine market
   so concentrated, and will it evolve towards monopoly? What implications
   does this concentration have for consumers, search engines, and
   advertisers? Does search require regulation, and, if so, in what form?
   This paper supplies empirical and theoretical material with which to
   examine these questions. In particular, we (a) show that the already
   large levels of concentration are likely to continue; (b) identify the
   consequences, negative and positive, of this outcome; and (c) discuss
   the regulatory interventions that policy-makers could use to address
   these.},

Title = {The paradox of (Inter)net neutrality: An experiment on ex-ante antitrust
   regulation},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {175},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Net neutrality has been the most relevant and heavily debated Internet
   regulation policy of the last decade. Net neutrality aims to prohibit
   discrimination between data packages in terms of content, origin,
   destination, or type of equipment used. However, the Big Tech companies,
   sheltered by the net neutrality policy, have flourished. They now have
   the power to exclude minor companies, and therefore their contents, from
   the Internet market in de facto defiance of the net neutrality
   principle. Academic results regarding this net neutrality paradox are
   still ambiguous. To represent the current Internet market distortions
   and analyze a potential tool to adjust and strengthen the net neutrality
   principle, an economic experiment based on an extended version of the
   dictator game was conducted. In particular, the effect of an ex-ante
   control and sanctioning mechanism on the collusive behavior of big
   companies was studied. The regulation mechanism proves effective,
   significatively reducing the abusive behavior of large Internet
   companies. This result contributes to the debate on net neutrality,
   reinforcing the idea that policymakers, given the current asymmetric
   Internet market structure, should revise and update net neutrality
   regulations.},

Abstract = {Implementation of the ecosystem business model can not only bring
   significant gains to a company, but also entail additional risks,
   including those of violating antitrust laws. The article analyses the
   Apple Inc. ecosystem, which has recently become the subject of a number
   of complaints from independent software developers and of antitrust
   investigations. The study shows how a unique position within the
   ecosystem can lead a company to market dominance. As a result, actions
   aimed at creating preferential conditions for the company's services can
   be interpreted as restricting competition through fostering a
   discriminatory environment and preventing independent software
   developers from entering the market. The analysis is based on public
   information about Apple's actions against third-party developers and the
   recent investigation into the company's conduct in response to the
   complaint by Kaspersky Lab. The reason for the initiation of legal
   proceedings was Apple's actions setting new rules for the App Store and
   resulting in improper functioning of the parental control application
   ``Kaspersky Safe Kids{''}. Methodologically, the study relies on
   ecosystem theory and the theory of industrial organization. The main
   research method is case study. The research demonstrates how Apple's
   actions can be interpreted in terms of such concepts as essential
   facilities, tying practices, aftermarkets, and leveraging of market
   power.These concepts are applicable to Apple's conduct, including the
   closed type of the ecosystem built by the company.},

Title = {Dissolving privacy, one merger at a time: Competition, data and third
   party tracking},
Journal = {COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Amid growing concern about the use and abuse of personal data over the
   last decade, there is an emerging suggestion that regulators may need to
   turn their attention towards the concentrations of power deriving from
   large-scale data accumulation. No longer the preserve of data protection
   or privacy law, personal data is receiving attention within competition
   and antitrust law. Recent mergers and acquisitions between large digital
   technology platforms have raised important questions about how these
   different areas intersect and how they can complement one another in
   order to protect consumer welfare while ensuring competitive markets.
   This paper draws attention to one particularly complicated kind of
   digital data-intensive industry: that of third party tracking, in which
   a firm does not (only or primarily) collect and process personal data of
   its own customers or users, but rather data from the users of other
   `first party' services. Mergers and acquisitions between firms active in
   the third party tracking industry raise unique challenges for privacy
   and fundamental rights which are often missed in regulatory decisions
   and academic discussions of data and market concentration. In this
   paper, we combine empirical and normative insights to shed light on the
   role of competition regulators in addressing the specific challenges of
   mergers and acquisitions in the third party tracking industry. After
   critically assessing some of the US and EU case law in this area, we
   argue that a bolder approach is needed; one that engages in a pluralist
   analysis of economic and noneconomic concerns about concentrations of
   power and control over data. (C) 2019 Reuben Binns and Elettra Bietti.

Abstract = {When competition authorities struggle to assess abusive practices by
   online multi-sided platforms, the issue does not appear to be defining
   markets or determining market power; rather, the difficulty is finding a
   fitting theory of abuse. In the search for such theories, one candidate
   has been overlooked: margin squeeze. This class of abuse has for the
   most part been confined to the telecom sector, but its potential reaches
   beyond. Indeed, the tendency towards vertical integration and subsequent
   conduct of online platforms could renew the relevance of margin squeeze
   as an analytical tool. To test this relevance, the article first
   examines the foundations of margin squeeze theory, while also addressing
   possible misconceptions. It then investigates whether this theory could
   be applied to online platforms with the help of three case studies
   (involving app stores, search engines, and online marketplaces). Where a
   company not only owns the digital infrastructure but also uses it to
   provide products, we find that margin squeeze can provide an appropriate
   assessment framework for anti-competitive conduct. Before concluding,
   the article contemplates the idea of neutrality underlying margin
   squeeze and related policies such as network neutrality.},

Abstract = {Digital wallets, such as ApplePay and Google Pay, are smart payment
   devices that can integrate payments with two-way, realtime
   communications of any type of data. Integration of payments with
   realtime communications holds out tremendous promise for consumers and
   merchants alike: the combination, in a single, convenient platform, of
   search functions, advertising, payment, shipping, customer service, and
   loyalty programs. Such an integrated retail platform offers consumers a
   faster and easier way to transact, and offers brick-and-mortar retailers
   an eCommerce-type ability to identify, attract, and retain customers. At
   the same time, however, digital wallets present materially different
   risks for both consumers and merchants than traditional plastic card
   payments precisely because of their smart nature.
   For consumers, digital wallets can trigger an unfavorable shift in the
   applicable legal regime governing the transactions, increase fraud risk,
   create confusion regarding error resolution, expose consumers to
   non-FDIC-insured accounts, and substantially erode transactional
   privacy. These risks are often not salient to consumers, who thus cannot
   distinguish between different digital wallets on the basis of risk.
   Consumers' inability to protect against these risks points to a need for
   regulatory intervention by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to
   ensure minimum standards for digital wallets.
   For merchants, digital wallets can divest valuable customer information
   used for antifraud, advertising, loyalty, and customer service purposes.
   Digital wallets can also facilitate poaching of customers by
   competitors, impair merchants' customer relationship management, deprive
   merchants of influence over consumers' payment choice and routing,
   increase fraud risk, subject merchants to patent infringement liability,
   and ultimately increase the costs of accepting payments. Merchants are
   constrained in their ability to refuse or condition payments from
   digital wallets based on the risks presented because of merchant rules
   promulgated by credit card networks. These rules raise antitrust
   concerns because they foreclose entry to those digital wallets that
   offer merchants the most attractive valuation proposition: wallets that
   do not use the credit card networks for payments.},

Abstract = {Although the EU competition regime is well-established and highly
   effective, EU policy actors may still need to rethink their tried and
   tested approach to competition regulation. This is what happened in the
   context of the European Commission's planned regulation of online
   platforms, embodied (in part) within the Digital Markets Act. This
   article reviews the interplay of the EU's competition regime with its
   relatively new Digital Single Market strategy to ask how a traditional
   ex-post approach to competition regulation came to be supplemented by a
   (proposed) ex-ante regulatory approach. Informed by the literature on
   policy change, the article examines the policy context, the Commission's
   experience gained in dealing with competition cases, and the input of
   lobbyists, advocacy groups and experts, to explain this shift in
   Commission policy.},

Abstract = {The price parity clauses (PPCs) that online booking platforms impose
   have come under antitrust scrutiny. Wang and Wright (2017) show how by
   preventing showrooming, a narrow PPC can reduce search costs and benefit
   consumers under between-platform competition. In response to having to
   give up its wide PPC to hotels, Booking.com emphasized its best price
   guarantee (BPG) to customers. We observe that a narrow PPC combined with
   a (low hassle costs) BPG leaves only Wang and Wright's Price Parity and
   Monopoly Equilibrium (PPME), in which consumers are worse off than with
   no platform operating at all. A more-efficient (incumbent) platform can
   deter entry with the BPG, while the narrow PPC eliminates competition
   from direct sales channels. An equally-efficient platform could enter
   and compete consumer prices down because of the existence of hassle
   costs, yet this equilibrium is fragile to network effects. If sellers
   have incentives not to price differentiate between platform(s) and their
   direct sales channel, a narrow PPC alone suffices to sustain the PPME in
   both cases. The detrimental pricing contract combination that we point
   out calls for different platform competition policy. (c) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {On 11 May 2017, the Italian antitrust and consumer protection authority
   (Autorita Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato, or AGCM) adopted two
   decisions in its proceedings against WhatsApp. Both proceedings,
   initiated under the consumer protection mandate of AGCM, relate to
   WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy (together referred to as
   ``ToS{''} hereinafter). In particular, one qualified as ``unfair{''} and
   ``aggressive{''} WhatsApp's process of obtaining user consent for its
   updated ToS, while the other established the unfairness of specific
   clauses of WhatsApp's ToS. This comment will address the former
   decision, while making reference to other proceedings opened against the
   consumer communication service or its mother company in relation to its
   latest ToS update. (C) Nicolo Zingales. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {As antitrust becomes more complex, so do its remedies. While access and
   disclosure remedies have been a part of antitrust law since the very
   earliest days of the Sherman Act, they have become a vital part of
   litigated cases and settlements only recently in both the United States
   and the European Union. This has been particularly true for cases
   involving network industries, telecommunications, broadcasting, software
   platforms, and other high-technology industries at the forefront of
   antitrust enforcement. Interestingly, these cases and settlements
   constitute an informal revival of the essential facilities doctrine and
   an acknowledgement that the doctrine (and its equivalents) remain an
   important and needed part of the antitrust toolkit. This article will
   examine the growing use of complex behavioral remedies in both merger
   and monopolization cases, which suggest antitrust enforcement has moved
   far beyond any stated preference for structural remedies. Among the
   examples I use are the Microsoft and Intel litigation in the United
   States and the European Union, as well as more recent merger consent
   decrees involving Google-ITA, Comcast-Universal, and
   Livenation-Ticketmaster to illustrate these important changes in
   competition law enforcement and what they portend for the future.},

Title = {Platform power in the video advertising ecosystem},
Journal = {INTERNET POLICY REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4, SI},
Abstract = {Platform power is a societal concern on many levels. Thus, we argue that
   addressing it with the common market competition approach is limited.
   The research we present aims to develop and test an alternative approach
   to conceptualising and assessing platform power. We propose a framework
   that operationalises the concept of the integrated platform ecosystem by
   bounding it with theories of harm to citizen wellbeing. Applying it,
   instead of defining a market, we use a specific, novel theory of harm to
   define the audiovisual advertising ecosystem. Our investigation into the
   dynamics of this ecosystem and conditions shaping them incorporated
   elite interviews with representatives of firms involved, document
   analysis and an examination of legal frameworks in a sample of four
   European jurisdictions. The evidence we present points to an inherent
   bias in the opacity of trading and to systemic advantage in relationship
   building, as well as potential power imbalances at `nodes' where data is
   used for targeting, planning, and metrics. We discuss the policy
   implications of these findings and suggest specific questions for
   regulators to be asking.},

Abstract = {Oliver Williamson's contributions to many subfields of economics are
   salutary. However, he was recognized by the Nobel Laureate Committee
   primarily for his work on the boundaries (scale and scope) of the firm.
   This tribute endeavors to marry Williamson's transaction cost economics
   with a capabilities framework to obtain new insights into how the scope
   and scale of technology companies influence their competitive
   performance in today's digital economy. The role of big data and
   learning are highlighted. Strong implications for competition policy,
   and for management, emerge from the fusion of the two frameworks. Such
   fusion yields a more granular view of management and policy issues but
   requires the policy analyst to understand not just industrial economics
   but also the technology management literature which also has useful
   insights for competition policy and regulatory professionals.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {79},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The empirical analysis of media platforms economics has often neglected
   the multihoming behaviour of advertisers. Assuming away the
   cross-substitutability and/or complementarity between the advertising
   slots of different platforms could damage the quality and the robustness
   of counterfactual analysis. To evaluate the consequence of such an
   abstraction, we compare the simulation results of hypothetical platform
   mergers when the demand on the advertising side is derived from a
   Translog cost model which allows for multi-homing, and when it is
   approximated by using a simple log-linear inverse demand model that
   ignores the differentiation among media platforms' advertising slots.
   Ignoring the existence of substitutes or complements on the advertising
   side would result in over-predicting the losses of the viewers' surplus
   and in underpredicting the gains in platforms' revenues. (C) 2021

Title = {THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF COMPETITION POLICY, CONSUMER POLICY AND

Abstract = {Currently, the European Union finds itself in troubled waters. It has to
   prove that its benefits outweigh the costs of its endeavour. In this
   respect, an EU competition policy that focuses on consumer welfare is
   one way to gain support by the citizens of its member states. The
   Roaming Regulation that has reduced the mobile communications costs
   while travelling abroad serves as a good example for this approach. The
   EU Commission views consumer policy as another important factor to
   protect and benefit customers. In markets with natural monopolies, the
   two policies require the support of an effective regulatory policy. The
   research demonstrates that these three policies - if harmonised - are
   able to lead to an increase in consumer welfare (primarily by reducing
   prices) and that they protect the rights and interests of consumers. In
   the case of telecommunications, several initiatives of the European
   Commission and of national regulatory authorities to falls in prices and
   forced operators to implement customer friendly rules and to protect
   customer data and privacy.
   The authors consider that the European Commission has tried to establish
   and harmonise rules across all member states in order to protect the
   interests and rights of consumers on the telecommunication market. The
   enforcement of competition and consumer policy within institutions from
   the telecom field certainly could promote the focus on consumers and the
   possibility to use a large ``toolbox{''}. Harmonising and adjusting the
   policies across different countries and institutions and minimising any
   possible side effects is nevertheless a challenging task for the EU
   Commission in the future.},

Abstract = {This article examines which platform policies the European Commission
   has developed over the last couple of years and whether its policies are
   taking into account the differences in platform power. We first identify
   the main structures of platform power. Secondly, we confront the
   European Commission's policies affecting media and communication
   platforms with those structures. Thirdly, we discuss whether what the
   European Commission is doing will make sense in the longer run. We end
   with some conclusions and recommendations for further research and
   policy. Our main finding is that the approach of the European Commission
   cannot live up to expectations, simply because it is too fragmented in
   terms of tackling the different dimensions of platform power together.
   Moreover, in the focus on detrimental effects of (some) platforms on
   competition, public interest issues often remain neglected.},

Title = {Multi-sided platforms and innovation: A competition law perspective},
Journal = {COMPETITION \& CHANGE},
Abstract = {We propose a simple theoretical model emphasizing the importance of a
   multi-sided platform (MSP) in fostering innovation. This model aims to
   assess the effects of structuring industries around an MSP on innovation
   dynamics and emphasizes the impact of cross-platform competition. It
   teaches us how to encourage cross-platform competition in terms of
   competition policy. The outcome is threefold. To begin, the presence of
   an MSP is critical for market innovation. Second, our findings indicate
   that skewed market power in favor of the MSP may stifle innovation in
   this industry, even if the negative impact on the industry's rate of
   innovation is not immediately apparent. Finally, we demonstrate that
   industries with multiple MSPs have a higher rate of innovation. The
   model's conclusions emphasize the critical importance of preserving the
   contestability of digital markets through competition rules enforcement.
   Even if the inherent technical characteristics of this industry result
   in a situation of dominance, competition rules should aim to preserve
   the possibility of market competition through, among other things,
   interoperability requirements, data portability requirements, and
   control of exclusivity clauses.},

Abstract = {The authors examine prominent placement of search engines' own services
   and effects on users' choices. Evaluating a natural experiment in which
   different results were shown to users who performed similar searches,
   they find that Google's prominent placement of its Flight Search service
   increased the clicks on paid advertising listings by more than half
   while decreasing the clicks on organic search listings by about the same
   quantity. This effect appears to result from interactions between the
   design of search results and users' decisions about where and how to
   focus their attention: users who decide what to click on the basis of
   relevance were more likely to select paid listings, whereas users who
   are influenced by visual presentation and page position were more likely
   to click on Google's own Flight Search listing. The authors consider
   implications of these findings for competition policy and for online

   Industry},
Journal = {WORLD COMPETITION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {135-162},
Abstract = {This article provides an economic analysis of recent vertical and
   horizontal mergers in the US industry for audio-visual media content,
   including the AT\&T-Time Warner and the Disney-Fox mergers. Using a
   theory-driven approach, we examine economic effects of these types of
   mergers on market competition, focusing on digital media content
   distribution.
   In doing so, we address three research questions: (1) Is the current
   development of the industry with its recent merger activity concerning?
   (2) Would vertical or horizontal integration be more preferable for
   overall welfare and competition in this industry? (3) What are
   implications for antitrust policy?
   We conclude from our analysis that in the already highly horizontally
   concentrated US market for audio-visual content the process of further
   vertical integration creates concerns from a competition. policy
   perspective. Moreover, even though horizontal concentration on some of
   the market stages may be anticompetitive as well, vertical integration
   is likely to be more harmful. As a consequence, we recommend a stricter
   approach to vertical merger control in this industry, as well as a more
   active abuse control against already vertically integrated media
   companies.},

Abstract = {The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) published its study group report
   on data and competition policy in June 2017.
   The Competition Policy Research Center (CPRC) considered that it was
   necessary to draw a distinction between personal data and industrial
   data to initiate the analysis.
   The study group discussed a basic approach to collection and utilization
   of data, potential anticompetitive conduct and factors to be considered
   in merger review.
   The CPRC concluded that the current framework under the Antimonopoly Act
   is applicable to most competition concerns about the collection and
   utilization of data.
   However, there remain issues not yet addressed, such as `digital
   cartels'. JFTC should pay attention to these issues that may require
   further consideration.},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The central and often neglected problem in the evaluation of competitive
   effects in platform cases is that the boundaries of the relevant market,
   usually simply a tool for the analysis of market power, can give raise
   to substantially different procedural routes depending on whether the
   antitrust market comprises the platform as a whole or just one side.
   Based on a comparative assessment across jurisdictions, the article
   argues that the excessive importance of the relevant market creates a
   potential mismatch between the economic consequences and doctrinal
   implications stemming from market definition in multi-sided platform
   cases. The article concludes that a more desirable framework for
   evaluating competitive effects should remain independent from the way
   market definition is carried out.},

Title = {The promise and potential of transgovernmental cooperation on the
   international data privacy agenda: Communicative action, deliberative
   capacity and their limits},
Journal = {COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {One of the great oxymorons and paradoxes of information technology
   regulation is that the governance of data privacy around the world to a
   large extent occurs through transgovernmental cooperation by data
   privacy commissioners; however, it has hardly received any attention
   among legal or political science scholars. Despite an increasingly
   prominent role that data privacy is gaining on an inter-governmental
   level and the United Nations agenda, an international community still
   struggles to find ways to cooperate over data privacy regulation. This
   paper aims to contribute to the international data privacy discourse by
   analysing data privacy authorities' ('DPAs') prospects to influence the
   international data privacy agenda and cooperation. The article aims to
   build upon and go beyond the existing descriptive narratives of the
   DPAs' functions and networks by applying the theoretical framework of
   the transgovernmental networks and Habermas theory of communicative
   action to data privacy to examine the potential and limits of the
   transgovernmental cooperation among the DPAs beyond European level which
   has not been analysed yet in legal or political science scholarship. The
   paper argues that while the transgovernmental cooperation by data
   privacy authorities represents a significant governance alternative to
   the more conventional intergovernmental cooperation, it is questionable
   whether that is sufficient to de facto alter the cooperative stalemate
   between the EU and USA and change the regulators/landscape in data
   privacy governance on an international level. While the hopes for data
   privacy commissioners could be high, the experience in other
   issue-areas, even the ones that are considered very `successful'
   examples of transgovernmental cooperation, such as the Basel Committee,
   International Organization of Securities Commissions, and International
   Competition Network, requires some caution. This is so given that many
   of the factors impeding cooperation in other areas, including
   incompatible regulatory philosophies, politicisation of issues, the
   limited ability of regulatory cooperation to bind other governmental
   actors, and the presence of distributive conflicts, appear to be present
   in the area of data privacy as well. Thus, the paper concludes that
   aspirations that the data privacy authorities may, in the words of
   Anne-Marie Slaughter, create `a genuinely new set of possibilities' for
   a future governance of data privacy where deliberation takes over and
   eliminates the power disparities and national interests are likely to
   remain elusive at least in the nearest future. (C) 2015 Monika

Title = {Fending Off Critics of Platform Power with Differential Revenue Sharing:
   Doing Well by Doing Good? br},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Abstract = {Many digital platforms have accrued enormous power and scale, leveraging
   cross-side network effects between the sides they connect (e.g.,
   producers and consumers or creators and viewers). Platforms motivate a
   diverse spectrum of producers, large and small, to participate by
   sharing platform revenue with them, predominantly under a linear
   revenue-sharing scheme with the same commission rate regardless of
   producer power or size. Under pressure from society, lawsuits, and
   antitrust investigations, major platforms have announced revenue sharing
   designs that favor smaller businesses. We develop a model of platform
   economics and show that a small-business oriented (SBO) differential
   revenue sharing design can increase total welfare and outputs on the
   platform. Although smaller producers almost always benefit from the
   shift in revenue sharing design, spillover effects can also make large
   producers better off under some conditions. More interestingly, we show
   that platforms are the most likely winner under a differential revenue
   sharing scheme. Hence, an intervention that ostensibly offers
   concessions and generous treatment to producers might well be
   self-serving for platforms and good for the entire ecosystem.

Abstract = {After a three-year investigation the German Competition Authority (GCA)
   found Facebook's data policy to be abusive. In its assessment the
   authority stated that, by making the use of its social-networking
   service conditional upon users granting extensive permission to collect
   and process their personal data, Facebook unlawfully exploited its
   dominant position in the German market for social networks. Hence, the
   GCA has found a way - uniquely German-specific - to limit Facebook's
   ability to gather, combine, and analyse data. In order to achieve this,
   it has acted as a self-appointed enforcer of data protection rules,
   establishing a violation previously undetected by any data protection
   authority and placing a `special privacy responsibility' on dominant
   firms.},

Title = {THE SEPARATION OF PLATFORMS AND COMMERCE},
Journal = {COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {119},
Number = {4},
Pages = {973-1098},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A handful of digital platforms mediate a growing share of online
   commerce and communications. By structuring access to markets, these
   firms function as gatekeepers for billions of dollars in economic
   activity. One feature dominant digital platforms share is that they have
   integrated across business lines such that they both operate a platform
   and market their own goods and services on it. This structure places
   dominant platforms in direct competition with some of the businesses
   that depend on them, creating a conflict of interest that platforms can
   exploit to further entrench their dominance, thwart competition, and
   stifle innovation.
   This Article argues that the potential hazards of integration by
   dominant tech platforms invite recovering structural separations.
   Separations regimes limit the lines of business in which a firm can
   engage, either by proscribing entry in certain markets or by requiring
   that distinct lines of business be operated through separate affiliates.
   Previously implemented both as a standard regulatory intervention and
   key antitrust remedy in network industries, structural separations have
   been largely abandoned. At the same time that lawmakers have weakened or
   eliminated sector-specific regulatory regimes, judicial interpretation
   of antitrust law has drastically narrowed the forms of vertical conduct
   and structures that register as anticompetitive. And when antitrust
   enforcers have targeted these forms of conduct and structures, they have
   applied remedies that generally (1) fail to target the underlying source
   of the problem and (2) overwhelm the institutional capacities of the
   actors assigned to oversee them. Neglecting structural remedies results
   in both substantive harms and institutional misalignments-effects that
   are especially pronounced in digital platform markets.
   This Article seeks to give structural separations a seat back at the
   table. Tracing the history of separations reveals that they have been
   motivated by a host of functional goals, ranging from fair competition
   and system resiliency to media diversity and administrability. Recalling
   this broader set of concerns brings into focus the range of factors at
   stake when dealing with dominant intermediaries and invites
   consideration of the degree to which separations in platform markets
   would also respond to a diverse set of problems.},

Abstract = {The complexities of platforms are increasingly at odds with the narrow
   legal and economic concepts in which their governance is grounded. This
   article aims to analyze platformization through the metaphorical lens of
   a tree to make sense of information ecosystems as hierarchical and
   interdependent structures. The layered shape of the tree draws attention
   to the dynamics of power concentration: vertical integration,
   infrastructuralization, and cross-sectorization. Next, the metaphor
   helps to revision the current patchwork of European regulatory
   frameworks, addressing the power asymmetry between citizens and the
   data-driven systems through which their daily practices are governed.
   Finally, the platformization tree serves to identify points of
   intervention that may inform European regulatory bodies and
   policy-makers to act as agents of change. Taking a holistic approach to
   platformization, this visual metaphor may inspire a set of principles
   that reshapes the platform ecosystem in the interest of society and the
   common good.},

   platform},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {177-195},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Exploitative abuses, especially excessive pricing, have been one of the
   most debated forms of abuse of dominant position. Unlike exclusionary
   abuses, they have been prohibited only under certain jurisdictions and
   on rather rare occasions. In Europe there have been few recent decisions
   and investigations that have reiterated existing approaches and tests
   for establishing excessive pricing. The Turkish Competition Authority's
   Sahibinden.com decision has come at such a time where the discussion on
   excessive pricing has been somewhat revived. However, this decision
   stands out as it is the first one where a competition authority has
   found prices to be excessive and therefore abusive in the context of a
   two-sided platform. Competition in platform markets display unique
   dynamics that may be very different from what may be observed in
   traditional markets especially in terms of pricing strategies. This
   article aims to demonstrate, through the Turkish Competition Authority's
   recent decision, the difficulties in applying existing tests and
   criteria on excessive pricing to a two-sided platform. A thorough
   analysis of this decision demonstrates that competition enforcement in
   what may be called `new' platform markets necessitates new approaches or
   adjustments of existing ones.},

Title = {A duty of care to prevent online exploitation of consumers? Digital
   dominance and special responsibility in EU competition law},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {406-427},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Article 102 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union imposes a
   special responsibility on undertakings with a dominant position. Digital
   dominance based on data but also on network effects, platforms, and
   first user advantage can lead to extreme inequality in bargaining
   positions with regard to online services, which can result in unfair
   treatment of competitors, suppliers, and consumers-such as exploitation
   and discrimination. Online consumers are the focus of this article. In
   order to tackle competition issues regarding online consumers, I propose
   interpreting the special responsibility of digitally dominant
   undertakings as a duty of care in their regard. Digitally dominant
   undertakings may not just be burdened by but also benefit from this
   approach, which increases predictability and trust in online markets. It
   resembles treating online undertakings as information fiduciaries as has
   been proposed in the USA, but is different because privacy is not the
   driving concern here and the context is that of antitrust. I look at
   standards for triggering the duty of care and make proposals for the
   application of this norm, but both remain to be specified further.},

   external apps are largely aligned with those of consumers, while this is
   not necessarily the case for the ad-funded platform. In particular,
   consumers gain from a positive commission set by the device-funded
   platform because this implies a lower price of the device, and the
   platform's apps are introduced and priced internalizing the impact on
   consumer welfare, perfectly in models of horizontal differentiation and
   partially in models of vertical differentiation.

Abstract = {For firms at the center of platform-based ecosystems, Teece (2018)
   argues that dynamic capabilities can enable the firms to create and
   capture value by building ecosystems and designing appropriate business
   models. In line with the original Profiting From Innovation (PFI)
   framework, Teece (2018) also argues that complementary asset providers
   may be able to capture substantial value. Here we provide a theoretical
   analysis that explains the ways in which dynamic capabilities underpin
   not only value creation but also value capture by platform leaders. We
   propose that three types of dynamic capabilities at a minimum are
   critical for platform leaders: innovation capabilities, environmental
   scanning and sensing capabilities, and integrative capabilities for
   ecosystem orchestration. We further argue that integrative capabilities
   play a key role in improving the ability of platform leaders to capture
   value.},

Abstract = {Platforms are everywhere. The rise of Uber, Netflix, and Facebook has
   attracted a lot of attention to this business model. However, despite
   its relevance and presence in the digital economy, the definition of
   platforms, their main characteristics, the intuitions about how they set
   prices, solve coordination issues, or choose their ownership structure
   seem to be scattered in many papers. This review attempts to organize
   the last two decades of research on multisided platforms around three
   essential elements of platforms: price structure, network effects, and
   control rights. We highlight which definitions are used in the
   literature, how they are related to the defining characteristics of
   platforms, and what research has been made on those characteristics. We
   pay special attention to the research done on pricing, coordination
   problems, and ownership structure. We conclude by reviewing the
   theoretical evidence around monopolization and competition policy in
   multisided markets.},

Abstract = {Antitrust and patent law exist in permanent tension, with patentholders
   permitted to engage in conduct that would otherwise be plainly
   anticompetitive. Given the over five hundred billion dollars of annual
   R\&D investment in the United States, and given the importance of R\&D
   for corporations' long-term economic profits, the broad deference given
   in antitrust law to patentee conduct is shocking. Continuing such
   deference misunderstands the purpose of antitrust law and undermines the
   purpose of patent law. This Note focuses on one area where this tension
   should be resolved in favor of increased antitrust enforcement:
   strategic patent licensing arrangements whereby a patentee transfers a
   share of its monopoly profits in order to control its competitor's R\&D.
   Such strategic arrangements can be used in 1) a duopoly where large
   competitors agree to divide an existing market; and 2) a platform
   technology where the patent holder encourages inventions that follow on,
   rather than compete with, an existing patent. This Note argues that
   anticompetitive strategic patent licensing is currently addressable
   under existing antitrust doctrine. By defining a market for research and
   development, regulators can successfully litigate against strategic
   licensing without needing to extend existing antitrust doctrine.
   Defining a market for research and development, moreover, connects the
   academic push for dynamic antitrust analysis into the existing static
   antitrust framework, allowing courts to gain experience with dynamic
   analysis in a more comfortable static setting. Lastly, while this Note
   is broadly theoretical, this is not by choice, but a byproduct of the
   broad-scale secrecy surrounding patent license agreements. Accordingly,
   this Note calls for the FTC to use existing statutory authority to begin
   investigating the real-world anticompetitive uses of strategic patent
   licensing.},

Abstract = {This study summarizes the issues in the promotion of data distribution,
   how huge digital platformers conduct in the market, and the actual
   regulations and initiatives for them. In particular, it briefly examines
   the actual status of litigation under US antitrust law and the issues.
   The study discusses the following five points: First, it highlights the
   delineation of the relevant market, which is also the first entry point
   in competition analysis. Second, it undertakes the existence of monopoly
   power, which requires the analysis of dominant firms. Third, it analyzes
   the conduct of forming, maintaining, and strengthening market power.
   Fourth, it analyzes the consumer damages. Fifth, it discusses whether
   antitrust actions are needed to solve the problems and remedies.},

Abstract = {One of the few things former President Donald Trump and leading
   Democrats appear to agree on is the need to subject Big Technology
   ({''}Big Tech{''}) firms to antitrust scrutiny. But unsurprisingly they
   disagree about how to address the problem. Senator Elizabeth Warren and
   many other leading Democrats have called for breaking up large
   technology firms, such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, in a revival of
   the trust-busting progressive era of the early twentieth century. In
   contrast, the Trump administration triggered more traditional antitrust
   monopoly review of potential anticompetitive activities of a number of
   leading technology firms, which is more likely to lead to financial
   sanctions (or more modest consequences).},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology, since its introduction, has been expected to be
   implemented in many areas. Cryptocurrency is one unique example that
   established a functioning application. On the other hand, blockchain
   technology is not immune to various challenges related to the nature of
   itself, privacy management, and antitrust laws, among others. This study
   lays out the nature of blockchain and applications in the maritime
   industry, while highlighting the bottlenecks. Potential resolutions and
   anticipated developments are proposed. To do this, we adopt a systematic
   approach and present an overview of blockchain in maritime literature.
   In addition, the fundamental problems with blockchain are investigated,
   beginning from their essentials to the pain points that are claimed to
   need improvement. For establishing a legitimate and practically
   meaningful blockchain platform, stakeholders need to achieve pluralism
   (consensus validation), privacy, and security of the system.},

Abstract = {Data control, among the newest forms of power fostered by information
   and communication technologies (ICTs), triggers a continuous
   (re)negotiation of public and private orderings, with direct
   implications on both regulators and intermediaries. This article
   examines the stance of the European Union (EU) regarding the position of
   Google - the world's largest internet services company as per its 2014
   market value - in two controversial instances: the `right to be
   forgotten' and the implementation of EU competition rules. It provides
   an analysis of these evolving debates and their meaning for EU
   regulatory thrust more broadly, discussing the shift in the approach to
   digital markets and the proactive development of a European framework
   influential beyond continental boundaries.},

Title = {Online platforms and pricing: Adapting abuse of dominance assessments to
   the economic reality of free products},
Journal = {COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {263-280},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Online platforms, which are at the forefront of today's economy, are
   subject to intensive competition law enforcement. However, the platform
   business model presents challenges for the application of competition
   law. Most notably, they appear to offer consumers a great number of
   their products for free. The explanation for most of these supposedly
   free products is offered by two-sided market theory: consumers may not
   be paying, but the `other' side of the market is. This other side of the
   market often consists of advertisers, which pay the platform for access
   to the consumers' information (to target advertisements) and attention
   (to show the advertisements). As many of these platforms are now
   potentially dominant, they come within the scope of competition law's
   abuse of dominance provision, including the doctrines of predatory and
   excessive pricing. These price-based theories need to adapt to the often
   price-less platform business model in order to prevent competition
   authorities from making both type I and type II enforcement errors. At
   the same time, competition law enforcement needs to consider-and at
   times give priority to-other branches of law that address abusive
   behaviour concerning free products. Through the use of case studies,
   this article therefore suggests ways in which abuse of dominance
   assessments can take into account the economic reality of free products.

Abstract = {Calls for ``public utility-style{''} regulation (and ``common
   carriage,{''} as the two terms are - erroneously - often used
   interchangeably) are increasingly expanding into policy debates
   concerning all layers of the Internet. These calls rely on various
   rationales, ranging from traditional economic concerns to more nebulous
   ones, such as reputational harm and privacy, ``social utility,{''} and
   ``social commons{''}. This increases the opacity of the debate. Despite
   the divergence in rationale, these calls all raise the same underlying
   question: whether digital platforms amount to ``informational
   monopolies{''} and should be subject to corresponding regulatory
   frameworks, possibly imposing neutrality upon these players. This
   article explores the conflation between the notions of common carriage
   and public utility. It shows how, in the digital ecosystem, the quest
   for terminological clarity is a substantive issue and serves as a point
   of departure for investigating whether the notion of public utility
   accurately describes broadband access and digital platforms. Emphasizing
   the content removal episodes, this article also sets the stage for a
   taxonomic re-classification, exploring (i) the applicability of the
   ``public forum{''} doctrine to privately-owned entities providing
   services where users gather to discuss online; and (ii) the
   applicability of common carrier/nondiscrimination/due process
   obligations to services offering support for speech and commerce.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the power of large technology corporations has become a
   focus of public debate in both developed and developing countries. This
   growing chorus brings together complaints about breaches of privacy and
   data protection, competition and market consolidation, and electoral and
   other political interference. The most powerful of these companies have
   grown into behemoths by establishing themselves both as purveyors of
   their own products, and as the hosts of ``platforms{''} that
   circumscribe, and profit from, the activities of other organizations.
   This platform function gives these companies substantial power over
   their commercial rivals, who depend upon these platforms to operate.
   More fundamentally, this article argues, the dual function of these
   ``platform companies{''} allows them to straddle the very categories
   that we use to organize our understanding of the political and economic
   world. They are at once product companies, service companies and
   infrastructure companies; players in the market and markets of the
   marketplace; private platforms and public spheres. The straddling of
   these categories places these companies in the institutional cracks of
   the regulatory system. Moreover, companies consciously exploit this
   regulatory straddling to thwart challenges to their power. This article
   argues that such deliberate shape-shifting has allowed these companies
   to control the political and economic stage on which their own power
   must be contested, and compromised the ability of scholars, the public
   and ultimately states to see clearly, and therefore constrain, that
   power.},

Abstract = {Online platforms have the characteristics of a particular type of market
   known as `multi-sided'. These businesses create value by bringing
   advertisers and users together. Access to user data is critical to this
   process. On the basis of economic literature, the features of
   multi-sided platforms will be discussed. It will be argued that the
   characteristics of multi-sided platforms increase the likelihood that
   successful companies become dominant due to the existence of indirect
   network effects. In these circumstances, dominant platforms may
   foreclose competition by raising barriers to entry in the large
   collections of user data. This may give rise to access problems for
   competitors and new entrants that need access to data gathered by
   dominant platforms in order to provide competing or complementary
   services. A comparative legal analysis will be used to assess the
   standards that are applicable in the United States (US) and the European
   Union (EU) for finding liability for refusals to deal under antitrust or
   competition law. The private antitrust cases that have already occurred
   regarding access to user data in the US show that the scope of
   applicability of the US essential facilities doctrine is very limited
   after the judgment of the Supreme Court in Trinko. Although the European
   Commission and the European Court of Justice seem to be willing to
   accept liability for a refusal to deal more easily than their US
   counterparts, high legal hurdles still have to be met under the
   essential facilities doctrine in the EU. Nevertheless, there are
   scenarios in which liability for refusals to give access to data will
   likely be accepted in the EU. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Innovation is regarded as the spearhead of consumer benefit in a
   competitive market. However, a strategy of predatory innovation presents
   the innovator with a shower of opportunities to close down the market
   and drive out competitors, thereby directly affecting consumer
   sovereignty. An inquiry into the relationship between innovation and
   market structures is not only important to assess the impact of such
   forms of the market on innovative activities, but also for a
   well-founded and evidenced framing of principles of antitrust laws in
   respect of Intellectual Property Rights (`IPRs'). Therefore, this
   article makes a case for the legal recognition, across jurisdictions
   including India, of predatory innovation in the context of high-tech
   markets to uphold the objectives of the antitrust regime, i.e., consumer
   ivelfare. The article traces the progressive steps taken by developed
   jurisdiction in this context and highlights how a similar approach could
   be adopted by India, fitting its current framework.
   This article, firstly, discusses the impact the market structure has on
   the motives and incentives for a manufacturer to innovate; secondly,
   brings forward the anti-competitive nature of predatory innovation in
   high tech markets; thirdly, advocates for the need for legal recognition
   of the conduct of Predatory Innovation while noting the
   counterarguments; lastly, concludes with identifying the effects of
   recognizing Predatory Innovation as anti-competitive conduct.},

   This is prompted by growing concerns for user data exploitation and
   rival foreclosure on the part of big tech platforms. One particular area

   specifically, within-conglomerate data sharing, where data collection is
   scaled up in digital ecosystems and monetized through avenues such as
   attention brokerage. A recent effort to address such concerns is Article
   5(a) of the Digital Markets Act proposal, which imposes a proscriptive
   obligation on gatekeeper platforms. This article rationalizes this ex
   ante approach to tackling exploitative data combination and highlights
   the need for further ex ante competition-enhancing measures that deal
   with the markets dominated by gatekeepers. Two directions are worth
   exploring: ecosystems compatibility and data as labour. Both underscore
   the importance of end users' right to data portability.},

Abstract = {In June 2019, Facebook announced its own cryptocurrency ``Libra{''} to
   be used through WhatsApp and Messenger, in order for its value to remain
   stable thanks to the support from banks and electronic commerce
   companies, linking to different currencies and the support of important
   companies. EU antitrust regulators investigated it as a ``threat to
   monetary sovereignty{''}. China is already testing its own DCEP
   cryptocurrency tied to state banks and major companies, with notable
   advantages. It will probably displace cash and be used even for world
   trade, which can make it an alternative to the traditional international
   payment system, compared to the current one led by the United States
   with the USD. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) offers ``the area and
   the route{''} to extend the Yen as a global digital currency. These new
   developments, and their rapid and high competitiveness produced as the
   ``art of bian Tian{''}, have generated intense concerns in the
   international financial system. Will the EU, Japan or the US be able to
   counter the virtual yuan so quickly?},

Abstract = {Shifts in global trade, technological developments and the COVID-19
   pandemic all provide an opportunity for Southeast Asia to grow its
   digital economy and accelerate economic recovery. Market dynamics are
   changing, with the rise of online platforms catering to the growing base
   of digitally literate consumers. Such platforms offer a wide choice of
   products and services at greater convenience, across borders and through
   different participants in the supply chain. Existing markets are
   becoming more competitive and new markets are being created as
   businesses benefit from digital technologies and draw insights from
   large volumes of available data. However, as the digital economy
   expands, sophisticated forms of anti-competitive behaviour are also
   emerging. Around the world, there are concerns that online platforms are
   becoming dominant and engaging in harmful conduct, such as collecting
   and using customer data-without consent-to exclude current and future
   competitors. Southeast Asia is vulnerable to these concerns, too. Using
   case studies, this study highlights why such concerns, if left

Title = {`We will all laugh at gilded butterflies'. The shadow of antitrust law
   on the collective negotiation of fair fees for self-employed workers},
Journal = {EUROPEAN LABOUR LAW JOURNAL},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The development of a wide-reaching collective representation for
   (genuine) self-employment and the collective negotiation of fair fees
   for independent contractors might often be more dissuasive vis-a-vis
   scam self-employment than the threat of reclassification. However, case
   law in both civil and common law jurisdictions showcases how antitrust
   law can hamper the collective negotiation of workers' minimum fees. The
   premise of such a view, which has its roots in the early stage of
   development of collective bargaining, is that the agreements setting the
   rates of pay for non-subordinate labour stand as restraints of trade.
   The author contends that this narrow interpretation of the scope of
   collective labour law - or rather this extensive view of the scope of
   antitrust law - is unacceptable. On the one hand, workers who personally
   carry out their activity cannot be treated as businesses operating on a
   free market, because they are - akin to the employees - individuals who
   lack the power to tangibly affect the terms and conditions of their
   work. For those persons, as the author recalls, collective bargaining
   have always stood for, even before the binary legal divide between
   employment and self-employment was drawn. On the other hand, it appears
   incongruous that a major challenge to the perimeters of collective
   labour law stems from a formalistic approach to a field of law
   (antitrust or competition law) which seeks to correct the market
   asymmetries in the interest of weaker parties, such as smaller
   businesses, communities and consumers. Ultimately, the author contends
   that a solution to overcome this legal hurdle cannot be found through a
   mere change in the interpretation of the existing US and EU competition
   and labour law rules, which have to be amended by the legislators in
   accordance with the current social needs.},

Title = {Strategic Surrogates or Sad Sinners: US Taxation of Bartering in Digital
   Services},
Journal = {AMERICAN BUSINESS LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {849-890},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused both a surge in technology use and a
   deterioration in government finances. At the same time, big tech
   companies are under scrutiny by lawmakers for tax avoidance, antitrust
   issues, and other concerns. These realities call for governments to
   reassess tax policy toward tech companies and for tech companies to
   reassess legal strategy toward taxes. State and federal governments' tax
   bases are eroding because of the noncash, barter nature of modern
   transactions. When a taxpayer uses ``free{''} digital services such as
   e-mail, social media, or search engines, she pays via access to her
   personal data or attention. From a legal and policy standpoint, these
   barter transactions should be taxed just as if cash had changed hands,
   but because it is not practicable to identify, value, and tax the data
   and time of each user, they have escaped taxation, giving many tech
   companies an unintended tax advantage. To address this unfairness, this
   article proposes a surrogate tax, through which the tech company acts as
   a proxy to pay the tax that is technically the liability of its users.
   In contrast to Digital Services Taxes (DSTs), which have been the main
   focus of policy makers and the extant literature, surrogate taxes adhere
   closely to standards of good tax policy, providing an administrable
   means of capturing untaxed digital barter while advancing fairness
   across the industry's business models. From a legal strategy standpoint,
   this article argues that tech companies themselves should support
   surrogate taxes, to avoid facing more onerous, ``sin{''}-like taxes,
   such as DSTs.},

Abstract = {Over the period 2015-2017, the five giant technologically leading firms,
   Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft (GAFAM) acquired 175
   companies, from small startups to billion dollar deals. In this paper,
   we provide detailed information and statistics on the merger activity of
   the GAFAM and on the characteristics of the firms they acquire. One of
   the most intriguing features of these acquisitions is that, in the
   majority of cases, the product of the target is discontinued under its
   original brand name post acquisition and this is especially true for the
   youngest firms. There are three reasons to discontinue a product post
   acquisition: the product is not as successful as expected, the
   acquisition was not motivated by the product itself but by the target's
   assets or R\&D effort, or by the elimination of a potential competitive
   threat. While our data does not enable us to screen between these
   explanations, the present analysis shows that most of the startups are
   killed in their infancy. This important phenomenon calls for tighter
   intervention by competition authorities in merger cases involving big
   techs. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study attempts to organize the regulatory perspective on the
   interaction between information law and competition law, especially for
   platform businesses. An online platform is an entity that mediates
   multiple groups of users, such as providers and users of products,
   services, and information, and has an indirect network effect as a
   two-sided market. The study illustrates the actions taken by online
   platforms, indicates attendant problems, and suggests responses to
   these. Four aspects of the competition policy issues related to online
   platforms are analyzed and discussed: data collection, data enclosure,
   data acquisition, and algorithmic transparency. The study considers
   essential online platform issues, such as promoting competition policy
   and fairness in information law application, to expand the discussion.
   Although fairness is important, there is a risk that the analysis of the
   effects of reducing competition is neglected and that interpreting
   fairness might increase the concern regarding over-execution. Having
   dis-aggregated the elements of fairness, the study suggests the need to
   establish specific standards.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Consumers can buy concert tickets from primary platforms (e.g.,
   Ticketmaster) or from consumer-to-consumer resale platforms (e.g.,
   StubHub). Recently, Ticketmaster has entered and been trying to control
   the resale market by prohibiting consumers from reselling on competing
   resale platforms. Several states in the United States have passed or are
   discussing laws requiring tickets to be transferrable on any resale
   sites, worrying that platform integration-Ticketmaster controlling both
   the primary and the resale platforms-will increase ticket service fees
   and harm musicians and consumers. This article establishes a
   game-theoretic framework and shows that the opposite can happen:
   platform integration can lower the service fees in both markets,
   alleviating double marginalization in the primary market and benefiting
   the musician and consumers. Moreover, with platform integration, the
   presence of a small number of scalpers can counterintuitively reduce the
   ticket price and benefit the musicians and consumers. In addition,
   platform competition in the resale market may harm consumers. This
   article further shows that these insights apply in other markets (e.g.
   used goods, peer-to-peer product-sharing markets) and provides
   suggestive empirical support for the theoretical results.},

Abstract = {We document short-run changes in websites and the web technology
   industry with the introduction of the European General Data Protection
   Regulation (GDPR). We follow more than 110,000 websites and their
   third-party HTTP requests for 12 months before and 6 months after the
   GDPR became effective and show that websites substantially reduced their
   interactions with web technology providers. Importantly, this also holds
   for websites not legally bound by the GDPR. These changes are especially
   pronounced among less popular websites and regarding the collection of
   personal data. We document an increase in market concentration in web
   technology services after the introduction of the GDPR: Although all
   firms suffer losses, the largest vendor-Google-loses relatively less and
   significantly increases market share in important markets such as
   advertising and analytics. Our findings contribute to the discussion on
   how regulating privacy, artificial intelligence and other areas of data
   governance relate to data minimization, regulatory competition, and
   market structure.},

Abstract = {The rise of economically strong Internet platform companies has
   unsettled traditional communications markets. Consequently, debates over
   the appropriate handling of platformization have moved center stage,
   including discussions of which instrument-regulation or competition
   law-is to be master. This article looks into the complex relationship
   between the two and argues how the often-purported separation between
   them is conceptually of little avail. It distinguishes two phases of
   which is to be master and shows how these have similarities but also
   significant differences. Among other things, the first phase during
   liberalization and convergence was characterized by a perceptual bias
   against regulation and for competition law in communications. In
   contrast, in the second phase of platformization, there is
   acknowledgement of a need to modernize competition law and concurrent
   fears that it will be overstrained if employed as a primary instrument
   and panacea for every new challenge.},

Abstract = {As in so many areas of law and politics in the United States,
   antitrust's center is at bay. On the right, it is besieged by those who
   would further limit its reach. On the left, it faces revisionists who
   propose significantly greater enforcement. One thing the two extremes
   share, however, is the denigration of the role of economics in antitrust
   analysis. Two of the Supreme Court's recent antitrust decisions at this
   writing reveal that economic analysis from the right no longer occupies
   the central role that it once had. On the left, some proposals display
   indifference to their economic impact on important participants in the
   economy.
   The antitrust laws speak of the conduct they prohibit in economic terms,
   such as ``restraint of trade,{''} ``monopoly,{''} and lessening of
   ``competition.{''} They do not embrace any particular economic ideology,
   such as the Chicago school or institutionalism. Nor do they require the
   use of any particular economic model, such as perfect competition or
   oligopoly. This openness gives policy makers a great deal of room, but
   it is not an invitation to economic nonsense. Further, economics should
   not be a tool for picking a winning interest group and then manipulating
   the doctrine to get that result.
   The Supreme Court's 2019 Apple decision slighted the economics of
   passedon consumer harm, a central component in analyzing private damages
   actions for more than forty years, and one that is critical to measuring
   competitive injury. In AmEx, the Court neglected the kind of
   transactional analysis that would have uncovered the true injuries in
   that case, defined the ``relevant market{''} in such a way as to make
   that term economically incoherent, rejected a superior methodology for
   assessing power in favor of an inferior one, misunderstood completely
   the meaning and appropriate scope of free riding, and lost sight of the
   fact that marginal rather than total effects are central.
   Although the progressive wing of antitrust does a better job of
   identifying the problems that the competitive economy faces, some of its
   proposed solutions are calculated to make them worse. The pursuit of
   business concentration or bigness for its own sake will injure both
   consumers and labor far more than it benefits small business, who appear
   to be the intended beneficiaries. A proposal to forbid large platforms
   from selling their own products in competition with the products of
   others will harm both consumers and most small businesses, although it
   will benefit some large firms.
   When used correctly and without excessive ideology, economics is a
   powerful, neutral tool for helping people identify injuries to
   competition and appropriate fixes. Indeed, that is the first and best
   use of antitrust economics. Both extremes in this debate have ignored
   the first rule of rational antitrust policy: figure out who is getting
   hurt, and how.},

Abstract = {The forming features of markets with network effects including the
   software markets are essentially important for effective business models
   in various spheres of business activity. First of all, it is connected
   with understanding of network effect and reasons of its use which are
   key factors not only commercial success of products and services, but
   also forming of adequate measures of economic policy, including
   antitrust.
   The article describes the case against Google, Inc. and Google Ireland
   Limited company (affiliated company) on suspicion of violation of the
   Russian antitrust law. The market of the pre-installed applications for
   OC Android localized for Russia which represents the market with network
   effects is a subject of the economic analysis. The signs of antitrust
   violation include the characteristics of the multilateral markets, in
   particular a platform (app store of Google) on the sides of market
   without which very difficult to create and support directly the product
   at the market. Namely bundling or tying which can be considered as
   equivalent of excluding agreement to create barriers on the market for
   the potential newcomer.
   The description of similar cases like the case against Google, Inc.
   corporation and the Google Ireland Limited company, and also the case
   against the Microsoft company which showed all difficulties of law
   application in the field of monopolization constraint (in terms of USA
   antitrust law) or abuse of dominance (in terms of European antitrust
   legislation) have the opportunity to show the fact that such decisions
   can be justified in principle.},

Abstract = {Competition policy, today, is an essential element of the legal and
   institutional framework for the global economy. Increasingly, major
   issues of competition law enforcement and policy implicate the interests
   of multiple jurisdictions. This Article examines a range of related
   issues and developments, including the international dimensions of
   competition law enforcement and the resulting potential for both
   positive spillovers and conflicts of jurisdiction; issues concerning the
   role of competition policy in digital markets; issues concerning the
   application of competition law and policy in relation to intellectual
   property rights; issues concerning state-owned enterprises, subsidies,
   and the maintenance of competitive neutrality in markets; and recent
   progress in implementing standards to ensure procedural fairness
   (including transparency and nondiscrimination) in competition law
   enforcement worldwide. Consideration is given to the potential gains
   from greater international coordination with respect to aspects of these
   issues, while taking due account, also, of progress already made in
   relevant fora. Modest proposals are set out for related international
   dialogue, including in the context of the World Trade Organization
   ({''}WTO{''}) and other fora.},

Abstract = {In the last decade a number of internet-based multi-sided platforms have
   emerged that provide free services to, in some cases, millions of
   businesses. This article argues that under current norms in adversarial
   proceedings these platforms are likely to face large numbers of
   complaints in multiple jurisdictions, a substantial likelihood that at
   least one of these complaints will result in a false-positive decision
   against the platform, and material risk of a false-positive decision
   that results in catastrophic consequences. These effects result from a
   combination of business users of free services receiving a free
   litigation option they can pursue if they have any complaints; an
   adverse-selection problem that results from free services being
   particularly attractive to start-ups that do not have or want to invest
   capital in their businesses; and the sheer number of free-business users
   resulting in a high cumulative probability of at least one
   false-positive decision. After documenting these phenomena, this article
   argues that government policymakers, including competition authorities
   and courts, should adopt a heightened level of scrutiny concerning
   complaints from free business users. This heightened level of scrutiny
   is necessary to counteract the impact of excessive litigation on
   innovation by multi-sided platforms.},

Title = {Anti-monopoly supervision model of platform economy based on big data
   and sentiment},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {With the advent of the cloud computing era, big data technology has also
   developed rapidly. Due to the huge volume, variety, fast processing
   speed and low value density of big data, traditional data storage,
   extraction, transformation and analysis technologies are not suitable,
   so new solutions for big data application technologies are needed.
   However, with the development of economic theory and the practice of
   market economy, some links in the industrial chain of natural monopoly
   industries already have a certain degree of competitiveness. In this
   context, the article conducts a research on the anti-monopoly
   supervision mode of platform economy based on big data and sentiment
   analysis. This paper introduces the main idea of MapReduce, the current
   software implementation specifies a Map function that maps a set of
   key-value pairs into a new set of key-value pairs. It specifies a
   concurrent Reduce function that guarantees that each of all mapped
   key-value pairs share the same set of keys. establishes a vector space
   model, and basically realizes the extraction of text emotional elements.
   It introduces the theoretical controversy of antitrust regulation of
   predatory pricing behavior of third-party payment platforms, and
   conducted model experiments. The experimental results show that the
   throughput of 40 test users in 1 h of test is determined by two factors,
   QPS and the number of concurrent, where QPS = 40/(60{*}60)
   transactions/second. The time for each test user to log in to the system
   is 10 min, and the average response time is 10{*}60 s, then the number
   of concurrency = QPS{*}average response time = 40/(60{*}60){*}10{*}60 =
   6.66. This paper has successfully completed the research on the
   anti-monopoly supervision model of platform economy based on big data
   and sentiment analysis.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {81},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We introduce asymmetries across platforms in the linear model of
   competing two-sided platforms with singlehoming on both sides and fully
   characterize the price equilibrium. We identify market environments in
   which one platform has a larger market share on both sides while
   obtaining a lower profit than the other platform. This is compatible
   with higher price-cost margins on one or both sides, noting that in the
   latter case one margin must be negative. Our finding raises further
   doubts on using market shares as a measure of market power in platform
   markets.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurs interact with other digital platform users to pursue
   opportunities and develop their businesses. However, although digital
   platforms are important for entrepreneurs, little empirical research
   exists on how entrepreneurs interact using digital platforms to meet
   their goals. Existing research is overwhelmingly conceptual,
   digital-centric, focused on high-growth entrepreneurship, and in
   countries in the global north. This paper addresses this gap with
   empirical evidence on how digital platforms are used for interacting by
   different types of entrepreneurs at different stages of development, in
   Trinidad and Tobago. It explains how online and offline structures,
   rules, social norms and culture interconnect to influence
   entrepreneurship using the theory and method of technology affordances
   and constraints, the entrepreneurial ecosystems concept, and a
   multi-qualitative method.},

   Resulting from the Use of Algorithm Technology by Companies},

Abstract = {Digitalization has a growing impact on everyone's life. It influences
   the way consumers purchase products, read online news, access multimedia
   content, and even meet or interact socially. At the core of digital
   products lies algorithm technology, decision-making software capable of
   fulfilling multiple tasks: data mining, result ranking, user matching,
   dynamic pricing, product recommendations, and ads targeting, among
   others. Notwithstanding the perceived benefits of algorithms for the
   economy, the question has been raised of whether the use of algorithms
   by businesses might have countervailing effects on competition. Although
   any anti-competitive behavior typically observed in traditional markets
   can be implemented by this technology, a particular issue highlighted in
   discussions between researchers and practitioners is the concern that
   algorithms might foster collusion. Because of their capacity to increase
   market transparency and the frequency of interactions between competing
   firms, they can be used to facilitate parallel collusive behavior while
   dispensing competing firms with the need for explicit communication.
   Consequently, it is not excluded that algorithms will be used in the
   years to come to obtain the effects of a cartel without the need to
   enter into restrictive agreements or to engage in concerted practices.
   We evaluate the collusion risks associated with the use of algorithms
   and discuss whether the ``agreement for antitrust purposes{''} concept
   needs revisiting. The more firms made use of types of algorithms that
   enable direct and indirect communication between the competitors, the
   more likely those companies may be considered liable.},

Pages = {103-117},

Abstract = {In January 2013, the Federal Trade Commission closed its nineteen-month
   antitrust investigation into Google's search practices. The primary
   issue in that investigation was Google's use of Universal Search
   results. The argument that Google's display of Universals violated the
   antitrust laws appeared to rest on a theory of vertical foreclosure.
   Under the vertical foreclosure theory, Google's thematic results compete
   with third-party thematic search sites, and the ``proper{''} role for
   Google's general search engine was to act as an honest broker among the
   alternatives. The FTC's investigation and its resolution raised
   interesting antitrust issues, some of which were novel, and some of
   which were fundamental to sound antitrust enforcement. Among these are
   several that we consider in this article: (1) What is the nature of the
   economic relationship between Google and third parties that receive (and
   perhaps rely on) traffic referred to them by Google's general search
   engine?; (2) Is ``general search{''} a relevant antitrust market, and is
   general search a distinct product or service, inherently separate from
   thematic search?; and (3) Should innovations by Google that expand the
   scope of what its general search engine can do-and place it in
   competition with other websites-be viewed as ``monopoly leveraging{''}
   or, alternatively, as ``innovation competition{''}?},

Abstract = {Many of the leading controversies in competition policy in the last two
   decades, especially those surrounding the Microsoft case, reflect the
   challenges posed by platform industries. Unfortunately, too often
   economists and policymakers have drawn the wrong lessons when thinking
   about such industries. Central to our analysis is a more realistic view
   of the process of consumer coordination. Platforms often use ``usage
   revenue later{''} strategies to ensure that consumers coordinate on
   their platform. This greatly mitigates the possibility of inefficient
   lock-in or excessive dominance by a leading platform, but it makes
   inefficient fragmentation a greater danger. Thus regulation, rather than
   competition policy, may be more appropriate in addressing potential
   market failures arising in platform industries.},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to present quantitative tools to manage
   competition policy analysis in two-sided platforms, based on a common
   framework for transaction and non-transaction platforms. We explore
   tools for relevant market definition {[}Critical Loss Analysis and a
   small but significant non-transitory increase in price (SSNIP) test],
   unilateral effects indicators {[}Upward Pricing Pressure (UPP) and Gross
   Upward Pricing Pressure Index (GUPPI)] and tests for exclusionary

Title = {Non-linear pricing in E-commerce: an exploration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {1453-1475},

Abstract = {Purpose To understand the new non-linear pricing in E-commerce. The
   present paper aims to put forth an idea of using tie-in agreement in the
   electronic commerce market in the name of trust in India. According to
   the Indian antitrust law, tie-in agreement is not allowed to use as
   compulsory in an offer to the buyer. This means that a tie-in agreement
   cannot be a compulsion or only an option to the buyer. This means it can
   be an extra option. Design/methodology/approach The paper shows that
   using this logic the sellers are giving two options simultaneously to
   the buyer: (1) a commodity with a tie-in agreement and (2) the same
   commodity without a tie-in agreement. Therefore, there are two price
   mechanisms that are present. Now it is the decision of the buyer to
   choose between the two. These two price mechanisms create a new variable
   called trust. If the buyer selects the first option, then that buyer
   will not be treated as a trustworthy buyer, but in the second case, the
   buyer would be treated as a trustworthy or the affianced buyer.
   Therefore, the buyer would be leaning toward the second option. The
   paper proves that in the second option it would be difficult to minimize
   the consumer expenditure. As a result, there would be a situation of
   non-linear pricing in the name of trust which is hidden in the offer.
   The present work gives both theoretical models and empirical
   justifications. Findings We find that E-wallet is often used when a
   consumer orders food online but offline cash payment is preferred.
   Therefore, the offer does matter for the consumer. Hence, the offer can
   be used to make a tie-in arrangement. Therefore, even if there is a
   tie-in arrangement in online food servicing applications, the
   Competition Commission of India can restrict such practices as for
   illegal tying, the firm has to have the monopoly power in one market and
   there should be compulsory tie-arrangement in another market. But it
   does not mean that E-wallet tie-arrangement cannot be ignored as the
   monopoly power in the online food servicing market can influence the
   market share in the E-wallet market. Tie-in arrangement is also
   important, as the consumer has to spend more under cashback offer
   conditions which reduce the long-run gain of consumers.
   Originality/value The paper considered trust as a new element in forming
   non-linear pricing. This is new to this literature.},

Title = {The Effect of Outsourcing Pricing Algorithms on Market Competition},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Abstract = {A third party developer designs and sells a pricing algorithm that
   enhances a firm's ability to tailor prices to a source of demand
   variation, whether high-frequency demand shocks or market segmentation.
   The equilibrium pricing algorithm is characterized that maximizes the
   third party's profit given firms' optimal adoption decisions.
   Outsourcing the pricing algorithm does not reduce competition but does
   make prices more sensitive to the demand variation, and this is shown to
   decrease consumer welfare and increase industry profit. This effect is
   larger when products are more substitutable.},

Abstract = {In connecting buyers to sellers, some two-sided platforms require that
   sellers offer their lowest prices through the platform, disallowing
   lower prices for direct sales or sales through competing platforms. In
   this article, we explore the various contexts where such restrictions
   have arisen, then consider effects on competition, entry, and
   efficiency. Where there are plausible mitigating factors, such as
   efficiencies from platforms' price restrictions, we explore those
   rationales and compare them to the harms. We identify a set of responses
   for competition policy, look at experiences to date, and suggest some
   future attempts to improve the functioning of these markets.},

Abstract = {Recent high-profile merger and antitrust cases as well as policy debates
   worldwide have focused on the relationship between access to (big) data
   and firms' competitive advantages in digital markets. These discussions
   have brought forward numerous conceptual arguments for and against the
   conjecture that market power may be derived from a firm's access to big
   data. Based on a review of the economic, information systems and
   management literature, this paper presents an overview of the aggregate
   empirical evidence on the business value and economic benefits that
   firms can indeed create from big data in the Internet economy. Moreover,
   six facilitating factors for data-driven market power are proposed that
   enable a firm to establish a sustained competitive advantage based on
   the economic benefits from data. Finally, we point to policy measures
   which may address competitive concerns in data-driven digital markets
   and highlight opportunities for future information systems policy
   research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Competition between food retailers is often assumed to be asymmetrical,
   whereby one retailer may compete with another retailer but not vice
   versa. Little is known about how (a)symmetric competition among
   retailers currently is. One way to investigate this is to use word of
   mouth data. A mixed methods analysis of customer comments on social
   media confirms the existence of asymmetric competition among German food
   retailers, mainly between supermarkets and discounters. Overall,
   consumers compare competitors frequently on the basis of their
   assortments, the price-performance ratio as well as quality and
   freshness. The results have implications for competition policy and
   strategic management.},

Journal = {TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Pages = {514-529},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Motivated by the policy discussion in the EU whether to impose
   non-discrimination obligations for dominant online platforms, we analyse
   whether such regulation is warranted from an economic point of view. Our
   contribution is threefold. First, across several platform contexts, we
   identify (i) (paid) prominence of some third parties over others and
   (ii) the favouring of a platform's integrated services over independent
   entities as common discriminatory conducts of online platforms. Second,
   within this scope, we review the economic literature and find that
   discrimination in the form of paid prominence may often be in the
   interest of consumers. However, smaller or low-quality content providers
   are likely to be worse off, which gives rise to concerns regarding
   dynamic efficiency and long-term variety in those markets. Additional
   problems may arise if platform operators are vertically integrated with
   content providers. Third, based on these theoretical insights, we
   recommend that EU policy makers should not adopt a neutrality regulation
   for platforms prematurely. Instead, we recommend to impose new
   proportionate transparency rules for dominant platforms in order to
   facilitate the identification of actual misconduct and legal
   enforcement.},

Abstract = {As leading businesses organize themselves as two-sided platforms,
   developed economies competition authorities have adapted their practice.
   Younger jurisdictions also face the challenge to review and use new
   analytics. We explore the recent evolution of two-sided platform markets
   analysis in BRICS countries, focusing on a key point for competition
   policy enforcement: relevant market definition. The extensive review
   suggests that the countries have adopted the concepts and analytical
   practice for two-sided platform relevant market definition at different
   paces. Differences in competition policy institutional design might
   account for the heterogeneity. BRICS authorities with broader mandates,
   that handle larger number of cases, and with no separation between
   adjudication and investigation have lagged in the adoption of such tools
   and practices.},

Abstract = {Antitrust agencies in the United States and the European Union began
   investigating Googles search practices in 2010. Googles critics have
   consisted mainly of its competitors, particularly Microsoft, Yelp,
   TripAdvisor, and other search engines. They have alleged that Google is
   making it more difficult for them to compete by including specialized
   search results in general search pages and limiting access to search
   inputs, including scale, Google content, and the Android platform. Those
   claims contradict real-world experiences in search. They demonstrate
   competitors efforts to compete not by investing in efficiency, quality,
   or innovation, but by using antitrust law to punish the successful
   competitor. The Chicago School of law and economics teachesand the
   Supreme Court has long affirmedthat antitrust law exists to protect
   consumers, not competitors. Penalizing Googles practices as
   anticompetitive would violate that principle, reduce dynamic competition
   in search, and harm the consumers that the antitrust laws are intended
   to protect.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we show that stable outcomes exist in matching
   environments with complementarities, such as social media platforms or
   markets for patent licenses. Our results apply to both nontransferable
   and transferable utility settings, and allow for multilateral agreements
   and those with externalities. In particular, we show that stable
   outcomes in these settings are characterized by the largest fixed point
   of a monotone operator, and so can be found using an algorithm; in the
   nontransferable utility case, this is aone-sideddeferred acceptance
   algorithm, rather than a Gale-Shapley algorithm. We also give a monotone
   comparative statics result as well as a comparative static on the effect
   of bundling contracts together. These illustrate the impact of design
   decisions, such as increased privacy protections on social media, or the
   use of antitrust law to disallow patent pools, on stable outcomes.},

   developments in markets and technology. By contrast, this article
   emphasizes the political forces that have driven the transformation of
   the twentieth-century consolidated firm through the firm as a ``network
   of contracts{''} and toward the platform firm. Moreover, situating the
   United States in a comparative perspective highlights the distinctive
   ways US political-economic institutions have facilitated that
   transformation and exacerbated the associated inequalities.},

Abstract = {This article examines antitrust issues concerning digital platforms
   equipped with big data. Recent initiatives by the Japanese competition
   agency are highlighted, comparing them with those by the USA and EU
   competition authorities. First examined is whether competition among
   platforms would result in a select few super platforms with market
   power, concluding that AI with machine learning has augmented the power
   of super platforms with strong AI-capability, leading to increased
   importance of merger control over acquisitions by platforms. Next
   scrutinized is the argument for utility-regulation to be imposed on
   super platforms, concluding that wide support is limited to data
   portability, leaving competition law as the key tool for addressing
   super platforms, its core tool being the provision against exclusionary
   conduct, enforcement of which, initially, concerns whether to order
   super platforms to render their data accessible to their rivals. Passive
   refusal-to-share data needs to be scrutinized under the essential
   facility doctrine. Beyond passive refusal, platforms' exclusionary
   conduct requires competition agencies to weigh the conduct's
   exclusionary effects against its efficiency effects. Finally addressed
   is exploitative abuse, explaining its relation to consumer protection,
   concluding that competition law enforcement on exploitative abuse should
   be minimized, since it accompanies risk of over-enforcement.},

Abstract = {Sharing economy firms such as Uber and Airbnb facilitate trusted
   transactions between strangers on digital platforms. This creates
   economic and other value but raises concerns around racial bias, safety,
   and fairness to competitors and workers that legal scholarship has begun
   to address. Missing from the literature, however, is a fundamental
   critique of the sharing economy grounded in asymmetries of information
   and power. This Essay, coauthored by a law professor and a technology
   ethnographer who studies work, labor, and technology, furnishes such a
   critique and proposes a meaningful response through updates to consumer
   protection law.},

Abstract = {The technological revolution we have witnessed in recent years had led
   to the appearance of a new term within the framework of the digital
   economy: Big Data. The rise and consolidation of enterprises with major
   volumes of production based on business models that involve the
   gathering and processing of personal data has caused misgivings amongst
   the competition authorities, and has led to a conflict between defenders
   of the pro-competitive nature of Big Data and those who take a more
   sceptical view, who have warned of the possibility that these data
   policies may be used by companies as a tool for creating, consolidating,
   and extending their positions of power in the market.},

Abstract = {Digitization of trade documents such as the Bill of Lading (B/L) is
   advancing. Several approaches have discussed blockchain as a suitable
   technology in general but state that they lack privacy aspects.
   Motivated by the antitrust-by-design approach from antitrust law, we
   propose a novel approach called one B/L, one blockchain in which we aim
   to create a dedicated blockchain for each B/L process. With this
   approach, we aim to enhance privacy and confidentiality. We gathered
   first insights by implementing the approach using Hyperledger Fabric.
   The first results show that the approach is technically feasible but
   requires manual steps and must be further refined.},

Title = {Data sharing and interoperability: Fostering innovation and competition
   through APIs},
Journal = {COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have been identified by the
   European Commission as a key enabler of interoperability among private
   and public undertakings. Further, a systematic adoption of open and
   standardized APIs by firms and developers appears crucial to unlock
   competition and ultimately promote the flourishing of Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) innovation.
   Analysing the main European regulatory initiatives which have so far
   surfaced in the realm of data governance (right to personal data
   portability, free flow of non-personal data, access to customer account
   data rule, re-use of government data), it seems that the EU legislator
   is not tackling the matter consistently. Indeed, on one side, all these
   initiatives share a strong reliance on APIs as a key facilitator to
   ensure a sound and effective data sharing ecosystem. However, on the
   other side, all these attempts are inherently different in terms of
   rationale, scope and implementation. The article stresses that data
   sharing via APIs requires a complex implementation process and sound
   standardization initiatives are essential for its success. Moreover,
   data pooling agreements need to be targeted in advance by competition
   law so to incentivize their adoption and leverage their pro-competitive
   potential. As for pricing and compensation issues, we point out that
   placing excessive reliance on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory
   (FRAND) terms might be counterproductive. (C) 2019 Oscar Borgogno and

Abstract = {In Ohio v. American Express Co. the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that in the
   case of transaction platforms, a single relevant market must be defined,
   where both sides of the platform simultaneously consume the same good,
   namely, a transaction. Therefore, a plaintiff must show net overall harm
   to all sides of the market to satisfy its prima facie burden of proof.
   This case note argues that this rule is ill-suited to distinguish
   between procompetitive behavior and exercises of market power that can
   be justified with mere wealth transfers from one side of the market to
   the other. In line with an alternative allocation of the burden of proof
   proposed in the literature, this case note proposes a standard for
   evaluating countervailing benefits on all sides of the platform.
   Finally, the case note explains why the Court's analysis of the effects
   of the anti-steering provisions was based on faulty economic grounds and
   the cherry-picking of facts on the record developed at the district
   court.},

Abstract = {The administrative state is leveraging algorithms to influence
   individuals' private decisions. Agencies have begun to write rules to
   shape for-profit websites such as Expedia and have launched their own
   online tools such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's mortgage
   calculator. These digital intermediaries aim to guide people toward
   better schools, healthier food, and more savings. But enthusiasm for
   this regulatory paradigm rests on two questionable assumptions. First,
   digital intermediaries effectively police consumer markets. Second, they
   require minimal government involvement. Instead, some for-profit online
   advisers such as travel websites have become what many mortgage brokers
   were before the 2008 financial crisis. Although they make buying easier,
   they can also subtly advance their interests at the expense of those
   they serve. Publicly run alternatives lack accountability or like the
   Affordable Care Act health-insurance exchanges are massive undertakings.
   The unpleasant truth is that creating effective digital regulators would
   require investing heavily in a new oversight regime or sophisticated
   state machines. Either path would benefit from an interdisciplinary
   uniform process to modernize administrative, antitrust, commercial, and
   intellectual property laws. Ideally, a technology meta-agency would then
   help keep that legal framework updated.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning have reinforced the competitive
   position of leading online platforms. This Essay identifies two
   important sources of platform rivalry and proposes ways to maximize
   their competitive potential under existing antitrust law. A nascent
   competitor is a threatening new entrant that, in time, might become a
   full-fledged platform rival. A platform's acquisition of a nascent
   competitor should be prohibited as an unlawful acquisition or
   maintenance of monopoly. A disruptive incumbent is an established
   firm-often another platform-that introduces fresh competition in an
   adjacent market. Antitrust enforcers should take a more cautious
   approach, on the margin, when evaluating actions taken by a disruptive
   incumbent to compete with an entrenched platform.},

Abstract = {Some(1) platform enterprises in the Internet industry have formed a
   monopoly or monopoly trends, and the Internet antitrust problem has
   become a research hotspot. However, the use of market share as an
   anti-monopoly judgment is biased So we take e-commerce enterprises as an
   example and measure the market power of Internet platform enterprises by
   using the new empirical industrial organization (NEIO) methods The
   research shows that the high market share of large Internet platform
   enterprises hasn't had market power, and the whole industry still
   maintains high levels of competition. The conclusion of this paper
   provides a new foothold for regulation.},

Abstract = {We examine the consumer-welfare implications of Google's project to scan
   a large proportion of the world's books into digital form and to make
   these works accessible to consumers through Google Book Search (GBS). In
   response to a class action alleging copyright infringement, Google has
   agreed to a settlement with the plaintiffs, which include the Authors
   Guild and the Association of American Publishers. A federal district
   court must approve the settlement for it to take effect. Various
   individuals and organizations have advocated modification or rejection
   of the settlement, based in part on concerns regarding Google's claimed
   ability to exercise market power. The Antitrust Division has confirmed
   that it is investigating the settlement. We address concerns of
   Professor Randal Picker and others, especially concerns over the
   increased access to ``orphan books,{''} which are books that retain
   their copyright but for which the copyright holders are unknown or
   cannot be found. The increased accessibility of orphan books under GBS
   involves the creation of a new product, which entails large gains in
   consumer welfare. We consider it unlikely that Google could exercise
   market power over orphan books. We consider it remote that the static
   efficiency losses claimed by critics of the settlement could outweigh
   the consumer welfare gains from the creation of a valuable new service
   for expanding access to orphan books. We therefore conclude that neither
   antitrust intervention nor price regulation of access to orphan books
   under GBS would be justified on economic grounds.},

Title = {Merger regulation in the digital economy and the forgotten goal of
   innovation(dagger)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT},
Abstract = {The pursuit of the consumer welfare goal has not achieved competitive
   markets but instead resulted in highly concentrated markets in the
   digital economy with one or two market leaders. Markets that should be
   dynamic and innovative are controlled by powerful online platforms that
   thwart innovation and eliminate potential rivals through killer
   acquisitions. This article argues that safeguarding innovation and in
   particular disruptive innovation should play a much more explicit part
   in the European Commission's merger control especially in digital
   economy markets, where innovation is key to a healthy dynamic market.
   This could be achieved by adopting a stricter merger review process that
   places emphasis on whether innovation and potential competitors are
   negatively affected by the merger also in the long-run. The article
   argues that to achieve this a move away from the traditional price-based
   focus in merger reviews in line with the consumer welfare framework is
   required towards a structural approach that considers the impact on the
   market in the long-run and the dynamic aspects of the mergers under
   review, but this will occasionally require the Commission to say `no' to
   mergers. The result however, would be the safeguarding of innovation,
   the key to a healthy economy in the EU.},

Abstract = {The concept of property rights and notions of public and private are
   social constructions with a long history. In western society, the term
   ``enclosure{''} dates from 16(th) century Britain, where the Enclosure
   Movement was used to describe the political economic process of the
   privatization of ``pubic{''} or ``common{''} land. This term has been
   recently appropriated in legal discourse as the 2(nd) Enclosure Movement
   to describe the increasing privatization of knowledge and information as
   ``intellectual{''} property in a new electronic information environment.
   This paper further applies this notion of Digital Enclosure-enclosure in
   the digital age-to a particular form of knowledge that has an inherently
   quasi-public nature, technical standards and the standardization
   process.
   Standards and the practice of standardization are vital to an industrial
   and technological society. Standardization practice has been
   institutionalized on a global basis over the past century and a half but
   is undergoing significant challenge and change. It exists in the
   political economic environment of capitalism and market economics where
   there is a basic tension between competition and cooperation, resulting
   in an interweaving of three elements: standardization, intellectual
   property rights (IPR) and antitrust/competition policy. This paper
   explores current trends in standardization from the perspective of
   Digital Enclosure, including the rise of the consortia movement, IPR
   policy, business and commercial strategies, the open source movement,
   and technical innovation.},

Abstract = {After a period of dormancy, the topic of interim measures (IMs) in
   antitrust investigations has been brought back into the spotlight in the
   context of fastmoving digital markets. We analyze historical practices
   and criteria surrounding IMs in the United States and Europe. Then we
   present an economic model of the parameters underlying IMs, which can
   inform the decision of whether to pursue them. The two key parameters
   needed to determine the benefits of taking an IM are the relative
   magnitudes of irreparable harm to each party and the probability that
   the conduct is found to be anticompetitive. A resulting insight is that
   the overall size of the irreparable harms is not as relevant as their
   relative size (that is, asymmetry). Increasing both types of harm in the
   same proportion would not change the decision to use an IM. However, an
   increase in the overall size of irreparable harms increases the expected
   benefit from IMs as a tool, if they are used optimally. Finally, we
   examine the characteristics of the digital economy, finding that while
   such characteristics are likely to increase the benefits of IMs as a
   general tool, there is a need to carefully assess IM decisions on a
   case-by-case basis.},

Abstract = {The relationship between competition law and regulation is a perennial
   question in competition policy. This article considers what happens when
   we apply competition law within markets already subject to a degree of
   alternative regulatory intervention - and, more specifically, how the
   presence of regulation can inform the antitrust assessment exercise.
   First, it asks why we might need, but also be reluctant, to apply
   competition law to market problems arising in regulated sectors. It then
   examines the potential impact of regulation within the task of
   competition law assessment from three overlapping perspectives: (1)
   where regulation forms an integral part of the `legal and economic
   context'; (2) where a regulatory standard is applied to set the
   boundaries of competition on the merits; and (3) where competition
   intervention functions as a means of `course correction' to the
   underlying regulatory regime.},

   impact may be seen in prices set above the market level and suppressed

   not prepared for such technological advancement. The paper provides an

Title = {How to attribute the right to data portability in Europe: A comparative
   analysis of legislations},

Abstract = {The number of online services is constantly growing, offering numerous
   and unprecedented advantages for consumers. Often, the access to these
   services requires the disclosure of personal information. This personal
   data is very valuable as it concedes significant advantages over
   competitors, allowing better answers to the customer's needs and
   therefore offering services of a better quality. For some services,
   analysing the customers' data is at the core of their business model.
   Furthermore, personal data has a monetary value as it enables the
   service providers to pursue targeted advertising. Usually, the first
   companies who provide a service will benefit from large volumes of data
   and might create market entrance barriers for new online providers, thus
   preventing users from the benefits of competition. Furthermore, by
   holding a grip on this personal data, they are making it more expensive
   or burdensome for the user to shift to a new service. Because of this
   value, online services tend to keep collected information and impede
   their users to reuse the personal data they have provided. This
   behaviour results in the creation of a lock-in effect. Upcoming
   awareness for this problem has led to the demand of a right to data
   portability. The aim of this paper is to analyse the different
   legislative systems that exist or have been recently created in this
   regard that would grant a right to data portability. Firstly, this
   article draws up the framework of data portability, explaining its
   origin, general aspects, advantages as well as its possible downfalls.
   Secondly, the core of the article is approached as the different ways of
   granting data portability are analysed. In this regard, the possible
   application of European Competition Law to prohibit restrictions to data
   portability is examined. Afterwards, an examination of the application
   of U.S. Antitrust Law is made to determine whether it could be a source
   of inspiration for European legislators. Finally, an analysis of the new
   General Data Protection Regulation is made with respect to the
   development of data portability throughout the European legislative
   procedure. This article makes a cross-examination of legislations,
   compares them with one another in order to offer a reflection on the
   future of portable data in Europe, and finally attempts to identify the
   best approach to attribute data portability. (C) 2016 Barbara Van der

Abstract = {Market definition is a core concept of competition law around the globe,
   including in the European Union, the United States, and Brazil. In all
   three jurisdictions, antitrust authorities are grappling with the
   challenges of digital markets, often dealing with the very same digital
   players. The provision of zero-price services, the multisided nature of
   many digital platforms, and the implementation of entire digital
   ecosystems all challenge traditional approaches to market definition.
   But where there are common problems, there is a potential for common
   solutions. Through a comparative analysis of decisional practice
   relating to these past, present, and future challenges of digital market
   definition, this contribution maps the common ground already achieved
   while highlighting remaining gaps and possible solutions: for zero-price
   services-the past-it shows how a consensus has emerged on the theory and
   possible tools to define markets for `free' services. On multisided
   platforms-the present-it finds that no such consensus has been reached
   yet, but strides are currently being made in developing an overall
   framework. And on digital ecosystems, it analyses how this challenge of
   the future requires the development of a coherent approach that can be
   based on cross-jurisdictional insights from the past and present.},

Abstract = {The world's biggest consumer markets-the European Union and the United
   States-have adopted different approaches to regulating competition. This
   has not only put the European Union and the United States at odds in
   high-profile investigations of anticompetitive conduct, but also made
   them race to spread their regulatory models. Using a novel dataset of
   competition statutes, we investigate this race to influence the world's
   regulatory landscape and find that E.U. competition laws have been more
   widely emulated than the U.S. antitrust laws. We then argue that both
   ``push{''} and ``pull{''} factors explain the appeal of the E.U.
   competition regime: the European Union actively promotes its model
   through preferential trade agreements and has an administrative template
   that is easy to emulate. As E.U. and U.S. regulators offer competing
   regulatory models in domains as diverse as privacy, finance, and
   environmental protection, our study sheds light on how global regulatory
   races are fought and won.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the determinants of disparities in coverage by
   cell telephone systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. It uses a spatially
   disaggregated probit for over 990,000 grid cells with adjustments for
   spatial autocorrelation. Determinants include potential market size
   (population); cost factors related to accessibility (elevation, slope,
   distance from a main road, and distance from the nearest large city);
   and competition policy. Estimates indicate significant results for the
   supply-demand variables, and very strong results for the competition
   policy index.
   Simulations suggest that a generalized improvement in competition policy
   could lead to huge improvements in cell phone area coverage, and to an
   overall coverage increase of nearly 100\%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The widespread use of algorithmic technologies makes rules on tacit
   collusion, which are already controversial in antitrust law, more
   complicated. These rules have obvious limitations in effectively
   regulating algorithmic collusion. Although some scholars and
   practitioners within antitrust circles in the United States, Europe and
   beyond have taken notice of this problem, they have failed to a large
   extent to make clear its specific manifestations, root causes, and
   effective legal solutions. In this article, the authors make a strong
   argument that it is no longer appropriate to regard algorithms as mere
   tools of firms, and that the distinct features of machine learning
   algorithms as super-tools and as legal persons may inevitably bring
   about two new cracks in antitrust law. This article clarifies the root
   causes why these rules are inapplicable to a large extent to algorithmic
   collusion particularly in the case of machine learning algorithms,
   classifies the new legal cracks, and provides sound legal criteria for
   the courts and competition authorities to assess the legality of
   algorithmic collusion much more accurately. More importantly, this
   article proposes an efficacious solution to revive the market pricing
   mechanism for the purposes of resolving the two new cracks identified in
   antitrust law.},

Abstract = {Amid a global uptick in public interest in competition policy, questions
   have emerged about the fitness of tools available to international
   competition authorities, particularly in relation to the digital
   economy. Treatment of mergers has come under increased scrutiny, and
   while the competitive analysis of mergers is a rich vein of debate,
   equally important is the question of which mergers competition
   authorities decide to analyse at all. We provide a brief overview of the
   Canadian approach to pre-merger notification, the emerging challenges
   associated with but not limited to the digital economy, and the Canadian
   response thus far.},

Title = {Data-owning democracy or digital socialism?},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY},
Abstract = {This article contrasts two reform proposals articulated in recent
   debates about how to democratize the digital economy: data-owning
   democracy and digital socialism. A data-owning democracy is a
   political-economic regime characterized by the widespread distribution
   of data as capital among citizens, whereas digital socialism entails the
   social ownership of productive assets in the digital economy and popular
   control over digital services. The article argues that while a degree of
   complementarity exists between the two, there are important limitations
   to theories of data-owning democracy that have not yet received
   significant attention within the literature. The bulk of the article
   highlights three ways in which digital socialists would consider a
   data-owning democracy to fall short of achieving a more just digital
   economy: a lack of workplace democracy, limitations in terms of scope,
   and a lack of democratic control over long-term investment decisions in
   new technology. The article thus contributes to determining what is at
   stake in recent debates about how to democratize the digital economy.},

Abstract = {We examine the incentives of a monopolistic search engine, funded by
   advertising, to provide reliable search results. We distinguish two
   types of search results: sponsored and organic (not-paid-for). Organic
   results are most important in searches for online content, while
   sponsored results are more important in product searches. By modeling
   the underlying markets for online content and offline products, we can
   identify the sources of distortions for each type of result, and their
   interaction. This explicit treatment proves crucial for understanding,
   not only spillovers across markets, but also fundamental policy issues,
   such as the welfare effects of integration. In particular, integration
   of the engine with a small fraction of content providers is
   welfare-enhancing when incentives to distort are stronger for sponsored
   than organic search, but welfare-reducing in the opposite case. (C) 2015

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak disrupted markets and had a serious
   negative impact in economies across the world. Competition Authorities
   were at the forefront of initial public response measures through strong
   law enforcement and active market monitoring actions, temporary
   exemptions from competition provisions, merger control procedural
   adjustments and advocacy, an increasingly important function vis-a-vis
   Governments and all relevant stakeholders. Competition law and policy
   have therefore remained highly relevant during this period in both
   developed and developing countries. Current common challenges faced are
   raised by the increased digitalization of the economy and the dominance
   of digital platforms, especially considering the number and market share
   of micro and Small and Medium Sized enterprises (SMEs), the most
   seriously affected by the pandemic lockdown measures. Several
   jurisdictions and international organizations are equipping themselves
   with new legislation and instruments to address these challenges, namely
   supporting SMEs fair access to digital markets and promoting competitive
   public procurement, but less experienced and resource-constrained
   authorities of developing countries must prioritize otherwise.
   Competition advocacy is now more than ever a priority for them so that
   the economic recovery packages preserver open, fair, and equitable
   markets. International cooperation, bringing together developed and
   developing countries authorities, provides a crucial framework of
   support especially at this time. UNCTAD is particularly well placed to
   support developing countries' Competition Authorities contributions to
   ``building back better{''} in times of crisis.},

Abstract = {Innovation is vital to competition, consumer welfare and long-term
   economic growth. It has great societal benefits which should be promoted
   and protected. It is understood that innovation consists of several
   fundamental elements: creativity, risk-taking, value-addition, adoption,
   and destruction. Combing these elements allows for powerful new
   technologies to develop and change the way people travel, work and
   interact. Given this, a question arises as to whether and how
   competition law can protect and foster innovation in the digital sector.
   The aim of this article is to identify the challenges posed by
   innovation to competition law by demonstrating the difficulties of
   applying competition law to digital markets. The article also seeks to
   determine the role competition policy plays in ensuring innovation
   especially in securing access to competitively important data or
   preventing mergers that eliminate future rivals. Finally, the article
   suggests how the identified problems can be accurately solved and what
   has so far been achieved in this respect.},

Abstract = {We analyze public points of interconnection of Google, Amazon, Facebook,
   and Apple (GAFA) in the global North versus the global South to
   determine the degree to which their location preferences differ, if at
   all. We find that there is a statistically significant difference in
   GAFA locating in the global North versus the global South-a difference
   based on a country's wealth, specifically as given by per capita GNI.
   Approximately 38\% of countries classified as global North have a GAFA
   public point of interconnection, while 16\% of those classified as
   global South do. Apple has approximately 92\% of its presence in the
   global North, followed by Amazon (82.5\%), Facebook (73\%), and Google
   (72\%). Our findings suggest that competition and antitrust policy
   discussions of digital platforms should include information on the
   dynamics of interconnection infrastructure distribution, and for that,
   such information must be available. We also assert that a global
   consideration of the digital platforms market is necessary.},

Abstract = {The digital economy has significantly changed many aspects of our lives,
   including the way firms do business and compete with each other. In
   addition to the benefits the digital world has introduced, it has also
   brought challenges for competition law, including new ways to restrict
   competition, with computing algorithms representing one of the most
   prominent examples. Algorithms can lead to, facilitate and maintain
   anticompetitive collusion, and one of the most pressing tests for
   competition law and its enforcement in the digital world is algorithmic
   parallel conduct. The terminology introduced for this conduct in this
   article is `digital polyopoly'. Digital polyopolies encompass conditions
   similar to oligopolies, in particular, interdependency and transparency.
   However, unlike parallel conduct arising from oligopolies, digital
   polyopolies are not limited by their number of competitors. This new
   phenomenon requires fitted interpretation and rethinking of existing
   competition-law and economic concepts. What digital polyopolies are, how
   they differ from pre-digital era concepts and how competition law should
   tackle them (with a particular emphasis on the European Union
   competition law's concept of `concerted practice'), are questions
   explored in this article.},

Abstract = {Uber-Grab's merger had attracted antitrust scrutiny by competition
   authorities in Southeast-Asia. The merger between the two had created a
   large giant company that provides various services through a platform
   such as ridesharing and food delivery services. According to the deal,
   Grab will take over Uber's assets (ridesharing and food delivery
   service), and in return, Uber will take a 27.5 percent stake in Grab.
   Although Grab claimed that the merger would create a cost-efficient
   platform in Southeast Asia and put it in a better position to serve
   consumers, there was a genuine concern that the merger will reduce
   competition in the market and provide incentives to Grab to engage in
   anti-competitive behaviour such as increasing the price of its services.
   This article aims to analyse how different countries in Southeast Asia
   responded to the Uber-Grab's merger and measures taken to address
   competitive concerns ex-ante and ex-post-merger. Unlike other
   competition jurisdictions in Southeast-Asia, the Malaysia Competition
   Act 2010 contains no merger control provision, which empowers the
   Malaysian competition authority to block any merger that has the effect
   of substantially lessening competition. The studies on how other
   countries evaluated the Uber-Grab merger could assist Malaysia's
   competition authority to regulate the future behaviour of the big
   digital platform in the Malaysian market. This article was written based
   on research that relies on both primary and secondary sources. Primary
   sources include statutory provisions on competition, decision, proposed
   decision, interim measures, and others. while secondary sources include
   journal articles, news, internet resources, and others. The article also
   adopts a comparative approach in order to analyse the approaches and
   measures taken by the various merger control regimes in Southeast Asia
   in dealing with the Uber-Grab's merger.},

Journal = {WORLD COMPETITION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {349-366},
Abstract = {Despite the rise of two-or multi-sided platforms in the digital sector,
   there is not yet an established antitrust policy for defining relevant
   markets that involve such platforms. Difficulties arise in particular
   where services are granted for free to some users. This article explains
   which platform user groups form separate (sub-)markets and with which
   quantitative and qualitative methods substitution relationships can be
   assessed for each sub-market. Considering the need to take account of
   the interactions between all user groups of a multi-sided platform, it
   is suggested that separate relevant markets should be recognized for
   each user group with differing demands that individually interacts with
   the platform in order to procure a service. Such interaction requires
   direct contact and an exchange between user and platform. It does not,
   however, pre-suppose any payment stream as users may also `pay' with
   personal data, their attention or the granting of usage rights.
   Consequently, search engines, for instance, form a three-sided market
   consisting of i) a market for online search advertising existing between
   search providers and advertisers, ii) a market for web search services
   existing between search providers and Internet users, and iii) a market
   for indexing content existing between search providers and website
   operators.},

Title = {Crossing the Rubicon? The implications of RCEP on anti-monopoly
   enforcement on dominant E-commerce platforms in China},
Journal = {COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The rapid development of e-commerce has markedly influenced the daily
   lives of the Chinese people over the last two decades. The rise of
   dominant e-commerce platforms and accompanying alleged abusive practices
   may impair competition and cause harm to on-line consumers. Although
   China's Anti-Monopoly Law and E-commerce Law provide a legal basis to
   deal with these practices, Chinese competition regulators rarely
   undertake investigations into these platforms. The inability of the law
   to keep pace with digital advancements is compounded by outdated
   rationales and traditional practices. China's problems relate to
   e-commerce competition and its regulation, such as the old-fashioned
   anti-monopoly rationale and some abusive practices conducted by dominant
   platforms. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP),
   concluded in late 2020, provides specific provisions regarding
   e-commerce and competition, requiring its 15-member states to promote a
   competitive and integrated e-commerce market in the region. This article
   critically examines the potential implications the RCEP may have on
   China's anti-monopoly enforcement of dominant e-commerce platforms and
   argues that, despite China's recent efforts to regulate e-commerce
   competition, these developments are still insufficient to fulfil the
   requirements of the RCEP. (C) 2021 Peicheng Wu, Charlie Xiao-chuan Weng,

   boom to crisis and transformation},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {330-343},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article contributes to the understanding of the current
   transformation of the energy industry in Europe and the interplay
   between greening policies and digital technological innovation.
   It shows how, since the financial crisis, core players in the European
   energy industry ended up in a dualist limbo, between conventional and
   emerging business models. It documents how strategies and business
   models that delivered extraordinary financial performance in the first
   decade of the 21st century often failed dramatically after the 2008
   financial crisis. Yet it finds that incumbents with 1) a greener energy
   mix, 2) smaller scale and, quite naturally, 3) better financial
   performance fared better than others
   The study explores the emergence of new business models and finds that
   most of the emerging business models circle around the customer
   interface where digital solutions allow more flexible interplay between
   consumption and production of energy, and/or between several service
   alternatives to fulfill basic needs for customer home comfort.
   The article also discusses important policy implications: For
   competition policy, it indicates a shift from challenges of scale and
   scope towards challenges of regulating networks and dominant platforms.
   Furthermore, it highlights new policy dilemmas concerning balancing and
   energy storage to accommodate intermittent supply from renewables.},

Abstract = {Many online businesses seek and provide attention. These online
   attention rivals provide products and features to obtain the attention
   of consumers and sell some of that attention, through other products and
   services, to merchants, developers, and others who value it. The
   multi-sided business of seeking and providing attention is fluid with
   rivalries crossing boundaries defined by the features of the products
   and services. It is also dynamic. Rivals introduce new products and
   services, some involving drastic and frequent innovation. Online
   attention rivals impose competitive constraints on one another. Product
   differentiation tempers the significance of these constraints in
   particular situations. But the relevant differentiation mainly involves
   aspects of the attention that is procured and sold rather than,
   necessarily, particular features of the products and services used for
   acquiring and delivering that attention. Antitrust analysis should
   consider these competitive constraints in evaluating market definition,
   market power, and the potential for anticompetitive effects. The
   existence of competition among attention rivals does not imply that
   antitrust should reduce the vigor with which it examines mergers and
   exclusionary practices among these platforms. It just needs to look for
   problems in the right places.},

Abstract = {The debate over online privacy pays too little attention to the costs
   and benefits of the current systems of privacy protection and
   advertising-supported online applications. The costs of online
   privacy-related harm (such as identity theft) and of protective
   activities are small relative to the benefits from applications that are
   supported by online advertising, which depends on the collection of
   personal information. Advocates of increased privacy focus too much on
   increased privacy as a solution, and not enough on alternative forms of
   information security. Surveys show that consumers do not like targeted
   advertising, or the information collection that allows it, but this may
   be a form of rational irrationality. That is, it may not pay for
   consumers to understand the costs and benefits of reduced information
   use.},

Title = {DIGITAL MARKET PERFECTION},
Journal = {MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {117},
Number = {5},
Pages = {815-883},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Google's, Apple's, and other companies automated assistants are
   increasingly serving as personal shoppers. These digital intermediaries
   will save us time by purchasing grocery items, transferring bank
   accounts, and subscribing to cable. The literature has only begun to
   hint at the paradigm shift needed to navigate the legal risks and
   rewards of this coming era of automated commerce. This Article begins to
   fill that gap first by surveying legal battles related to contract exit,
   data access, and deception that will determine the extent to which
   automated assistants are able to help consumers to search and switch,
   potentially bringing tremendous societal benefits. Whereas observers
   have largely focused on protecting consumers and sellers from digital
   intermediaries market power, sellers like Amazon, Comcast, and Wells
   Fargo can also harm consumers by obstructing automated assistants.
   Advancing consumer welfare in the automated era requires not just
   consumer protection, but digital intermediary protection.
   The Article also shows the unpredictable side of the end of switching
   costs. If digital assistants become pervasive, they could gain the
   ability to rapidly direct millions of consumers to new purchases
   whenever a lower price or new innovation becomes available.
   Significantly accelerated consumer switching-what I call
   hyperswitching-does not inevitably harm society. But in the extreme it
   could make some large markets more volatile, raising unemployment costs
   or financial stability concerns as more firms fail. This new kind of
   disruption could pose challenges for commercial and banking regulators
   akin to those familiar to securities regulators, who deploy
   idiosyncratic tools such as a pause button for the stock market. Even if
   sellers prevent extreme hyperswitching, managers may strategically
   prepare for hyperswitching with economically costly behavior such as
   hoarding liquid assets or forming conglomerates to provide insurance
   against a sudden exodus of customers. The transaction-cost focused
   literature has missed more macro-level drawbacks.
   The regulatory architecture reflects these scholarly gaps. One set of
   agencies regulates automated assistants for consumer protection and
   antitrust violations, but does not go beyond those microeconomic
   inquiries. Nor do they prioritize strengthening digital intermediaries.
   Regulators with more macroeconomic missions lack jurisdiction over
   automated assistants. The intellectual framework and regulatory
   architecture should expand to encompass both the upsides and downsides

Abstract = {Governments and policymakers are considering intervening in the
   relationship between major tech companies and the news media industry
   and holding various inquiries and reviews to canvass reform options.
   This article provides a comparative study of Australia, Canada and the
   United Kingdom, some of the earliest countries in the world to engage in
   these policy processes. The study reveals that these media systems have
   devised similar regulatory tools and their approach aligns with a more
   disaggregated set of reforms occurring across Europe. While these reform
   agendas often draw on valuable concepts from media policy, they also
   awkwardly translate frameworks and introduce already questionable
   regulatory approaches to the platform environment. The most notable is
   the ongoing focus on stakeholders instead of the wider public interest.
   I end the paper by arguing the long-term sustainability of journalism
   need to be decoupled from attempts to limit platform power. I outline a
   more targeted regulatory response focussed on antitrust and privacy and
   note that journalism will receive downstream benefits from these
   efforts. The approach challenges the core issues associated with
   platform dominance and stands in contrast to current reform proposals,
   which threaten to hamper much needed institutional transformation across
   the journalism sector},

Abstract = {Antitrust law deals with economic matters as if they were all industrial
   processes, that is, processes through which companies transform inputs
   into outputs. In this sense, we could say that antitrust law is still a
   Nineteenth Century law, even when it comes to platforms that transform
   digital data into services. For this reason, when we look at blockchains
   through the lenses of antitrust law, they are either framed as the
   result of an industrial process (the blockchain as an output) or as a
   means that allows the development of an industrial process (the
   blockchain as a tool). However, these two pieces do not complete the
   puzzle: they do not say much about the competitive impact of
   blockchains. Studying the operating mechanisms of blockchains and, in
   particular, their governance, one realizes that the puzzle must acquire
   a new piece: the information on who controls the blockchain. This piece
   of information reveals that even dominant blockchains, which are still
   nowhere to be seen, could be harmless if truly devoid of any central
   authority and that even strategic exchanges of information via
   permissioned blockchains should not trigger any antitrust liability, if
   blockchains' administrators managed to allow the exchange only among
   non-competing participants. (c) 2021 Mariateresa Maggiolino and Laura

Abstract = {Although antitrust scrutiny of ``big tech{''} companies has increased
   drastically over the past decade, much of the national debate has
   concerned issues of monopolization and the Sherman Act-the dominant
   federal antitrust statute. But with rapid developments in artificial
   intelligence and machine learning, algorithmic price fixing has become
   an increasingly pressing threat that the Sherman Act is ill-equipped to
   tackle. Under the current framework, the challenge of establishing the
   existence of an agreement between competitors in cases in which the
   algorithms have evolved beyond their programmers' intentions presents
   difficulties to regulators.
   This Note underscores that section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission
   (FTC) Act offers a broader mandate to antitrust regulators and argues
   that it is the best vehicle for bringing price-fixing claims against
   companies that use algorithms to collude with one another. Unlike the
   Sherman Act, the FTC Act bans unilateral conduct and invitations to
   collude. It can reach collusive conduct without the showing of an
   agreement. While circuit courts have curbed the scope of the FTC Act by
   finding that tacit collusion is lawful, the FTC still retains the
   authority to bring standalone actions for section 5 violations. This
   Note presents a framework for regulators to consider when bringing a
   standalone section 5 action for algorithmic collusion. It argues that
   algorithms function as public announcements and should be scrutinized
   more carefully-first, for certain market characteristics indicating that
   collusion would benefit market players, and second, for the existence of
   plus factors that demonstrate the likelihood of actual collusion.},

Abstract = {It is conventional wisdom that transparency in cartels-monitoring of
   competitors' prices, sales, and profits-facilitates collusion. However,
   in several recent cases cartels have instead worked to preserve the
   privacy of their participants' actions and outcomes. Toward explaining
   this behavior, we show that cartels can sometimes sustain higher profits
   when actions and outcomes are observed only privately, because better
   information can hinder collusion by helping firms devise more profitable
   deviations from the collusive agreement. We provide conditions under
   which maintaining privacy is optimal for cartels that follow a
   market-segmentation strategy.},

Title = {The Uneasy Interplay between Digital Inequality and International
   Economic Law},

Abstract = {This article addresses the questions of what role international economic
   law has played in the story of digital inequality's emergence and
   evolution and how international economic law can reduce digital
   inequality instead of enhancing it. The first part of this study
   illustrates the uneasy interplay between digital inequality and
   international economic law. At the network layer, the economic benefit
   of the General Agreement on Trade in Services' Mode 3 (foreign
   investment) market access commitments in the telecommunications sector
   has never been realized in many developing countries and least developed
   countries (LDCs). There is a missing link between the consequences of
   trade liberalization and broadband investment. At the application layer,
   today's platformization of services was an `unforeseen development' at
   the time the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established. Through the
   pro-liberalization of WTO jurisprudence, members' decades-old Mode 1
   (cross-border) market access commitments have played more than a
   marginal legal role in global datafication. The second part of this
   study discusses how international economic law can confront and
   potentially redress that inequality. In the context of trade and
   development, it remains to be seen how the WTO members can find the
   common ground needed to balance digital trade liberalization and
   development needs. Unless infrastructure concerns from developing
   countries and LDCs are addressed, the ongoing WTO e-commerce trade deal
   may end up being labelled the Digital `Haves' Trade Agreement. In the
   context of trade and competition, the increasing inequality in digital
   platforms calls for a set of international competition rules to
   appropriately address market power in the data sector. By imposing
   cross-border disciplines for competition policy and thus curbing the
   power of big digital platforms, the proposed WTO Data Reference Paper
   may well be an effective instrument to address the second dimension of
   `digital inequality' - data colonization.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a broad retrospective evaluation of mergers and
   merger decisions in markets dominated by multisided digital platforms.
   First, we document almost 300 acquisitions carried out by three major
   tech companies-Amazon, Facebook, and Google-between 2008 and 2018. We
   cluster target companies on their area of economic activity providing
   suggestive evidence on the strategies behind these mergers. Second, we
   discuss the features of digital markets that create new challenges for
   competition policy. By using relevant case studies as illustrative
   examples, we discuss theories of harm that have been used or,
   alternatively, could have been formulated by authorities in these cases.
   Finally, we retrospectively examine two important merger cases,
   Facebook/Instagram and Google/Waze, providing a systematic assessment of
   the theories of harm considered by the UK competition authorities as
   well as evidence on the evolution of the market after the transactions
   were approved. We discuss whether the competition authority performed
   complete and careful analyses to foresee the competitive consequences of
   the investigated mergers and whether a more effective merger control
   regime can be achieved within the current legal framework.},

Abstract = {Competition assessment in Australia has traditionally been based on an
   evaluation of the market structure relying on five factors, namely the
   degree of market concentration, the height of barriers to entry, the
   extent of product differentiation, the extent of vertical integration,
   and the nature of arrangements between firms. These factors, known as
   the `QCMA factors', are characteristic of competition in the
   manufacturing industries of the `old economy'. Since the ascendancy of
   Chicago and Post-Chicago School thinking competition analysis in
   Australia has also taken into consideration non-structural factors.
   However, in light of the dominance of big tech companies in online
   markets, the so-called Neo-Brandeisian School' has advocated focusing on
   structural elements that are characteristic of online markets. This
   article examines to what extent the QCMA factors still a suitable
   structural framework for the assessment of competition in online
   markets.},

Title = {Brand Bidding Restraints Revisited: What Is the Appropriate Economic and
   Legal Framework for the Antitrust Analysis of Vertical Online Search
   Advertising Restraints?},

Abstract = {This article explores the law and economics of brand bidding restraints
   which constitute the most novel type of vertical restraints imposed by
   brand owners on their distributors in digital markets. The article tests
   and critically reflects on the restrictive approach European competition
   watchdogs have recently adopted towards these brand bidding restraints.
   It contends that this harsh antitrust treatment of brand bidding
   restraints is not sufficiently grounded in the economic analysis of
   vertical restraints. In proposing a comprehensive framework for the
   legal and economic analysis of brand bidding restraints, the article
   makes three principal contributions. First, it asserts that brand
   bidding restraints can have a number of procompetitive effects by
   internalizing advertising-related externalities, addressing free-riding
   on display and traditional advertising and facilitating fixed cost
   recovery through price discrimination. Second, the paper considers
   different ways through which brand bidding restraints may harm
   competition and consumer welfare when they disproportionately affect
   infra-marginal consumers, prevent meaningful intra- and inter-brand
   comparisons or result in price discrimination on the basis of search
   costs rather than brand preferences. Moreover, brand bidding restraints
   are of particular concern when adopted in the context of dual
   distribution systems where vertically integrated brand owners have an
   incentive to raise their retailers' costs to prevent them from
   cannibalizing on their own sales channel. Third, the article explore
   various filters that may inform an effects-based analysis of brand
   bidding restraints. In this respect, the article makes a number of
   policy recommendations for the future antitrust analysis of brand
   bidding restraints. These proposals could also inform the ongoing
   revision of the Vertical Block Exemption Regulation (VBER) and Vertical
   Guidelines in the EU and in the UK.},

Title = {Digital markets, competition regimes and models of capitalism: A
   comparative institutional analysis of European and US responses to
   Google},

Abstract = {The comparative capitalism literature examined how institutions vary on
   a national or societal level and how these differences affect
   multinational companies' strategies. Yet, little attention has been
   devoted to cross-national or regional differences in the governance of
   competition, especially in the context of digitalization of markets. The
   article seeks to fill this gap by looking at the case of Google. It
   traces the process of the stark US-EU disagreement over Google's abuse
   of dominant position in digital markets, which resulted in one of the
   largest fines in the EU history. It is argued that the variation in the
   response to the company's market and nonmarket strategies are traced
   back to differences between Ordoliberal and Chicago School ideas, which
   are embedded in the `competition regimes' of European and US capitalist
   models. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these
   findings for varieties of capitalism frameworks.},

Title = {Predatory Pricing and Platform Competition in India},
Journal = {WORLD COMPETITION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-120},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Predatory pricing has been a concern since the inception of competition
   policy. Scholars from different schools have large disagreements about
   it, with some arguing that predation does not exist to others
   considering it a legitimate threat to competition. As predatory pricing
   theory is largely concerned with price cost test, the issue is further
   complicated while looking at two sided platforms. Due to network
   effects, the value of the platform for the users changes with the number
   of users on the network. Therefore, the price of services is influenced
   by multiplicity of factors rather than just the cost of the service. The
   aim of the paper is to note such economic theory and apply this in the
   Indian jurisprudence on predatory pricing. Part I of the paper provides
   a non-technical introduction to the economics of two-sided platforms. It
   explains the rationale behind below cost pricing and critiques the usage
   of a price cost test for determining predation in case of two-sided
   platforms. Part II touches on the international regulation of predatory
   pricing and establishes the context for the Indian jurisprudence. Part
   III discusses the Indian jurisprudence surrounding predatory pricing.
   This elaborates on the legislative history and the judicial decisions
   concerning predatory pricing and platform competition in India. This
   part argues that the Indian jurisprudence has completely disregarded the
   economic theory of predation in case of two-sided platforms and the
   adjudications are merely based on a price cost test.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the Brazilian cable TV industry has experienced a sharp
   downturn. In parallel, the over-the-top platform Netflix gained
   popularity and Brazil has become one of its biggest markets. The
   objective of this paper is to investigate the competitive effects of
   Netflix's entry on the incumbent cable TV industry. We explore the
   regional variability of Netflix's popularity (measured by Google Trends)
   and combined this information with official data of the cable TV market.
   Using a two-way fixed effects estimator with state-month observations
   (covering the period of 2012-2019), we showed that the increase in one
   standard deviation in Netflix popularity is associated with a 3.62\%
   reduction in the density of cable TV subscribers and with a 19.69\%
   reduction in the number of small firms that operate cable TV.},

Abstract = {We study concentration in the European Internet upstream access market.
   The possibility of measuring market concentration depends on a correct
   definition of the market itself; however, this is not always possible,
   because very often in the Internet industry antitrust authorities lack
   reliable pricing and traffic data. We present an alternative approach
   based on the inference of the Internet operators' interconnection
   policies using micro-data from their Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   tables. We assess market concentration following a two-step process:
   first, we propose a price-independent algorithm for defining both the
   vertical and geographical relevant market boundaries; then we calculate
   market concentration indexes using two novel metrics. These assess, for
   each undertaking, its role both in terms of essential network facility
   and of wholesale market dominance. The results, applied to four leading
   Internet exchange points in London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Milan,
   show that some vertical segments of these markets are highly
   concentrated, while others are extremely competitive. According to the
   Merger Guidelines, some of the estimated market concentration values
   would immediately fall within the special attention category.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a symposium on the economics and regulation of pay
   broadcasting, First it reviews the costs of providing combinations of
   analogue and digital television programming and telecommunication
   services using a variety of possible combinations of technologies and
   discusses demand for such services, It then summarizes the extent of
   developments in digital television to date in a number of countries,
   This is followed by an analysis of competition issues likely to arise in
   the sector and a discussion of the capacity of competition policy and
   regulatory instruments to deal with them. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Abstract = {One important function of European regulatory networks (ERNs) is to
   provide national regulatory authorities (NRAs) with an institutional
   platform for coordinating the implementation and harmonization of
   Community law within the member states by issuing non-binding norms such
   as guidelines and standards. However, to what extent are NRAs successful
   in implementing these non-binding rules within their member states and
   what is the role of European networks of regulation? This article
   argues, and illustrates with a case study of the implementation of
   privacy norms in electronic health systems in the Netherlands, that next
   to the expertise generated by the relevant ERN, it was the institutional
   compliance of the Dutch government to the Privacy Directive that has
   substantially contributed to the bureaucratic autonomy of the Dutch Data

Abstract = {Government investigations and public scrutiny of Big Tech are at an
   all-time high. While current legal scholarship and government focus have
   centered overwhelmingly on whether and how antitrust law and 230 of the
   Communications Decency Act can be revised to address platform dominance,
   scant attention has been paid to another, almost unseen attempt to
   regulate Big Tech: copyright law. The recent adoption in Europe of
   Article 17 of the Copyright Directive, which holds internet platforms
   liable for user-generated creative content unless they obtain costly
   content licenses, is the most direct example of such regulation-and may
   serve as precedent for similar changes to U.S. law. Meanwhile, before
   the courts and in the executive branch, copyright holders are
   increasingly harnessing anti-Big Tech sentiment to advocate for
   everything from weakening fair use doctrine to terminating long-standing
   government oversight of certain concentrated content holders.
   As recent scholarship laments the role that copyright minimalism played
   in the meteoric ascent of large technology platforms, this Article
   argues that increasing copyright protection will not combat monopolies.
   The seemingly compelling public narrative that laws must be rewritten to
   combat power by any means necessary ignores the uniqueness of copyright
   markets as ones dominated not by diffuse, weak licensors bargaining with
   technology giants, but instead by large, oligopolistic content
   conglomerates. Changes in copyright laws that increase the cost of
   content licenses fail to address, and indeed will only enrich, the
   long-standing dominance of traditional content licensors. They will also
   entrench and concentrate licensees, creating a bilateral oligopolistic
   market for copyrighted works. And such changes will, ultimately, hasten
   the obsolescence of the very content industries that advocated for these
   reforms, as today's licensees evolve to become tomorrow's licensors.
   This Article concludes that to fight monopoly, to be truly
   neo-Brandeisian, one must think beyond copyright law.},

Abstract = {Numerous Internet platforms developed with novelty and innovation in
   knowledge society provide for the optimal utilization and integration of
   the Internet in allocation of social resources, development of digital
   trends, and absorption of new opportunities of the advanced digital
   economy. However, the corresponding challenges have come along with the
   development: the monopoly governance of Internet platforms has received
   more and more attention under the impetus of typical cases such as the
   ``Alibaba case.{''} This paper considers the basic content of Internet
   platforms and their monopolistic qualities as well. This will further
   elaborate the monopolistic nature of Internet platforms including
   ``two-for-one{''} behavior in relevancy to market and dominant position.
   This study will further explore the regulatory idea for the Internet
   platforms' antimonopoly. The purpose is to establish a sound
   comprehensive Internet governance system and promote the healthy and
   sustainable development of the platform economy.},

Abstract = {Privacy issues are becoming increasingly important during this time of
   rapid technological advance. This article addresses the important
   question of how the FTC might balance the consumer protection concerns
   arising in the context of privacy with competition issues. It will first
   examine the basic principles of consumer protection and competition law,
   the two core missions of the FTC, and then take a look at some cases and
   other actions by the FTC outside the privacy realm that illustrate the
   different modes of interaction between the two areas of law. The
   agency's careful balance of its two core missions becomes clear through
   this exercise. Next, the article will describe the most recent evolution
   of privacy law at the agency, and the FTC's preliminary staff report on
   privacy. Included in the discussion will be a review of some of the
   latest privacy protection proposals from industry members. Finally, the
   article will discuss the interplay of some core consumer protection and
   competition principles in analyzing the privacy protection proposals.},

Abstract = {This article focuses on the economics of digital markets with particular
   emphasis on those features that are commonly deemed critical for
   Antitrust. Digital markets are often concentrated due to network effects
   and due to the need of large amounts of Data for production. We review
   papers characterizing the nature of social harms caused by market power
   and the role of competition FOR the market and IN the market to relief
   some of that harm. Special emphasis is given to the role of (i) human
   attention (which is monetized and is a key input in advertising
   markets), (ii) Data (which is the oil that powers these markets) and
   (iii) innovation (incentives, entry for buyout and killer acquisitions).

Abstract = {Considerable progress has been made over the past 30 years in ensuring
   that US and EU merger control norms are broadly understood and
   respected; that decisions are taken by independent agencies unfettered
   by political influence; and that agencies cooperate with each other to
   avoid divergent outcomes. Notwithstanding these achievements, important
   challenges remain. In particular, the broad consensus around the
   objectives and architecture of merger control is increasingly being
   questioned. This article identifies the principal strengths of global
   merger control, describes its major challenges, and considers ways to
   modernize and strengthen the existing system.},

Abstract = {Based on a mix of conceptual insights and findings from cases, this
   paper discusses three ways in which the effectiveness of regulation in
   the areas of competition, data and consumer protection can be improved
   by tailoring substantive protections and enforcement mechanisms to the
   extent of market power held by firms. First, it is analysed how market
   power can be integrated into the substantive scope of protection of data
   protection and consumer law, drawing inspiration from competition law's
   special responsibility for dominant firms. Second, it is illustrated how
   more asymmetric and smarter enforcement of existing data protection
   rules against firms possessing market power can strengthen the
   protection of data subjects and stimulate competition based on lessons
   from priority-setting and cooperation by consumer authorities. Third, it
   is explored how competition law's special responsibility for dominant
   firms can be further strengthened in analogy with the principle of
   accountability in data protection law. Similarly, it is discussed how
   positive duties to ensure fair outcomes for consumers are developed in
   consumer law. The analysis offers lessons for improving the ability of
   the three regimes to protect consumers by imposing greater
   responsibility on firms with greater market power and thus posing
   greater risks for consumer harm.},

Abstract = {The landscape is a complex place where ecosystems and humans interact.
   Various actors have interests in landscapes and struggle for their
   livelihoods and benefits. The landscape itself is alive, growing and
   giving back either positively or negatively. No one can exactly project
   what can happen to a landscape in the future with these complex actor
   interactions. A non-computerized tool called ``Landscape Game{''} was
   developed based on game theory to help understand the dynamics of land
   competition, policy measures and sustainability of a landscape. The game
   combines concepts of Monopoly, SimCity, American Farmer, Snakes and
   Ladder, cellular automata, game theory and genetic algorithms. The
   Landscape Game operates on a landscape scale, covering a mosaic of
   various land cover and land use patches including forest that work as an
   ecosystem. Through this game, stakeholders can experiment with the
   likely impacts of human actions in a landscape where competing land uses
   and policy dynamics interact. Policy makers can learn how to maintain
   and improve the sustainability and productivity of a landscape by using
   various policy instruments, e. g., rules, taxes, land use, incentives
   and disincentives. This game introduces a variety of concepts such as
   landscape conservation, development, environmental services including
   REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation),
   investment alternatives, trade among players, and competition and
   collaboration. The game challenges rational players to maximize their
   revenues, while at the same time taking care of the ecological and
   social conditions. This paper describes how the Landscape Game was
   developed and played with various stakeholders as well as lessons
   learnt. We expected the game learning process to change players' mental
   model previously conveyed by the players.},

Abstract = {OTT messengers such as Facebook and WhatsApp have gained wide popularity
   among mobile users while the traffic of text messaging is in strong
   decline. As such, there is a debate over whether both services are
   interrelated and constitute a joint product market, which has important
   implications for the current wave of mergers in the mobile industry and
   regulation policy. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
   to provide an empirical analysis of how the consumption of OTT
   messengers affects demand for text messaging and mobile voice services.
   We make use of an innovative dataset which includes very detailed
   information on smartphone usage in Norway and consider a novel approach
   to address this question which is embedded in the complexity of
   two-sided markets. Interestingly, our findings suggest that OTT
   messengers complement demand for traditional mobile telecommunication
   services for this context. Consequently, both markets are interrelated
   but do not constitute a joint market from the perspective of competition
   policy in Norway. Moreover, we find an explanation for why reductions of
   text messaging usage have been so drastic in some countries and an
   analogous development for mobile voice is rather unlikely. Finally, our
   empirical results provide a new perspective on the modelling of consumer
   utility in communication networks in the theoretical literature.},

Abstract = {The patent system fosters innovation by granting the right to exclude.
   Since a rightsholder can legally suppress competition and charge
   monopoly prices, a patent provides a type of antitrust immunity. Even
   when firms allegedly abuse their exclusive rights through the creation
   of patent thickets, meritless infringement litigation, or breaching
   one's FRAND commitment, courts and federal agencies have concluded that
   antitrust is ill-equipped to discipline patent practices. Without
   antitrust remedies, firms have banded together against rightsholders to
   negotiate for better terms. Their strategies have included boycotting
   abusive patentees, as well as collectively negotiating against them. By
   using self-help remedies, they seek to pay fair rates for only the
   patents needed for their technology. This type of cooperation may
   ideally foster competition and innovation where patent abuses undermine
   both goals. The problem is, ironically, that combining against a
   monopolist is likely anticompetitive. Antitrust condemns collusion to
   manipulate prices-here, licensing rates-even when done against a
   monopolist. This renders a troubling outcome where ``Big Pharma,{''}
   ``Big Tech,{''} and others can insulate their monopoly power using the
   very laws meant to condemn monopolies. While debate has emerged about
   patent abuses, an equally salient issue involves whether antitrust
   should condemn firms who collude against patent holders and monopolists.
   Using economic and historical evidence, this Article argues that
   antitrust law should allow firms to defend an antitrust claim by citing
   their rival's market power. Our models show that powerful rightsholders
   do, in fact, harm competition and innovation in ways not meant to
   protect original technology. We then find that the benefits of collusion
   among smaller firms were advanced by the Sherman Act's drafters, whose
   comments are critical to shaping and understanding modern antitrust.
   Support even comes from the labor arena: Congress excluded workers from
   antitrust law-as labor unions were once considered a form of
   collusion-so that workers could counterbalance their employers'
   dominance with their own market power. As such, given the practical and
   theoretical difficulties of remedying anticompetitive abuses of patent
   rights under the antitrust laws, we assert that taking antitrust out of
   patent law would allow competition to flourish in dynamic markets while
   enhancing the patent system's incentives to innovate.},

Abstract = {The arrival of Trump in the White House does not augur well for the
   long-run prospects of the US economy. The protectionism that is
   gathering steam under his presidency may yield some short-term gains,
   but at the detriment of the long-run. Examining the discontent among
   ordinary voters that brought Trump to power, this paper argues that this
   should be treated as an opportunity for a major regulatory reform. With
   the advance of digital technology, we have increasing returns to scale,
   and that, in turn, is making our antitrust laws backfire and hurt the
   well-being of ordinary people, thereby sowing discontent. The paper
   builds a simple model to illustrate this and makes the case for revoking
   the older antitrust laws and replacing them with some simple
   profit-sharing rules at the level of the firm, and the economy. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Online platforms often impose Price Parity Clauses to prevent sellers
   from charging lower prices on alternative sales channels. We provide
   quasi-experimental evidence on the full removal of Price Parity Clauses
   in France in 2015 for hotels listed on Booking.com. Our analysis reveals
   significant price decreases in the short run, but a more limited effect
   in the medium run. However, hotels characterized by a more complex
   organizational structure decreased their prices more substantially.
   Overall, the intervention appears to have benefited a subset of

Abstract = {Monopolistic mechanisms can be detected in China in many respects
   through Chinese internet monopolists would outperform their peers in the
   US or the EU by. The Chinese government endeavors to keep its Internet
   industry globally competitive and thus authorities involved in antitrust
   activities tend to tolerate the oligopolistic structure of the market.
   This is evidenced most obviously in the repression of competitors in
   certain fields, e.g., `Baidu,' the `Chinese Google,' in the field of
   IT-services - leading to a stricter regime of monopoly control in terms
   of substantial law. However, in the course of enforcement, various legal
   and practical challenges impede the efficiency of these measures. This
   paper analyses existing competition law enforcement and proposes
   effective application of antitrust law for its enforcement in the
   Internet industry under present Chinese law.},

Abstract = {Many if not most markets with network externalities are two-sided. To
   succeed, platforms in industries such as software, portals and media,
   payment systems and the Internet, must ``get both sides of the market on
   board.{''} Accordingly, platforms devote much attention to their
   business model, that is, to how they court each side while making money
   overall. This paper builds a model of platform competition with
   two-sided markets. It unveils the determinants of price allocation and
   end-user surplus for different governance structures (profit-maximizing
   platforms and not-for-profit joint undertakings), and compares the
   outcomes with those under an integrated monopolist and a Ramsey planner.

Abstract = {The creation of open APIs is one of the core concepts advocated by the
   Web of Things community. However, drastically open APIs to the basic
   functional components of physical devices are only found in research
   projects and seem to not yet find favor with a wider audience. With this
   paper, I would like to initiate a discussion about the value of open
   APIs for the producers and users of smart devices, and for society as a
   whole: How can manufacturers be motivated to outfit their products with
   open APIs? How can consumers be educated about the benefits of not being
   locked into manufacturer ecosystems? And might the decision of opening
   up a device API even be subject to antitrust law?},

Title = {The agency and wholesale models in electronic content markets},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {69},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {I analyze a model of dynamic competition between retail platforms in the
   presence of consumer lock-in. Two different revenue models are
   considered, one in which platforms set final retail prices and one in
   which the suppliers set final retail prices. Platforms have long-term
   (or strategic) pricing incentives but suppliers do not, which implies
   that the inter-temporal price path faced by consumers depends on the
   revenue model in place. When suppliers set prices instead of platforms,
   prices may be higher in early periods but lower in later periods,
   suggesting that appropriate antitrust enforcement ought to consider more
   than initial price changes when an industry shifts to the agency model.
   Indeed, consumers may (but need not) prefer the agency model even when
   prices increase in initial periods. A potential downside of the agency
   model is that it may align the incentives of suppliers and platforms and
   thereby encourage platforms to lower the competitiveness of the supplier
   market, harming consumers; no such incentives exist under the wholesale
   model. I relate my results to events in the market for electronic books.

Title = {Market Definition and Market Power in Data: The Case of Online Platforms},
Journal = {WORLD COMPETITION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {473-505},
Abstract = {With the emergence of data as an asset for market players operating in
   the digital economy, questions have risen about the relevance of data
   for competition enforcement. This article focuses on the role of data in
   the competitive process between online platforms including search
   engines, social networks and e-commerce platforms. After arguing that
   situations can be identified in which access to data is a competitive
   advantage for incumbents and an entry barrier for new entrants, it is
   analysed how a relevant market for data can be defined and how market
   power can be established in such a market. Most providers of online
   platforms do not trade data as a stand-alone product as a result of
   which no supply and demand exists and no relevant product market for
   data can be defined under current competition law standards. However, it
   may still be appropriate for competition authorities in this situation
   to assess proposed concentrations and alleged abusive behaviour of
   dominant firms beyond the relevant markets for the services provided to
   users and advertisers. By defining a wider market for data, a form of
   potential competition can be taken into account whereby market players
   also compete for the asset that is used as an input to develop or
   improve services offered on online platforms.},

Abstract = {The role of online intermediaries in allowing third parties to perform
   legal as well as illegal activities and the growing economic power of
   such intermediaries are profoundly challenging the legal framework
   established 20 years ago with the European Union e-Commerce Directive.
   European courts first, and legislatures more recently, have taken a
   position regarding the need for further regulation of online
   intermediaries. The new liability rules for copyright infringement are
   just an example of a more general tendency to charge intermediaries with
   responsibility. This tendency goes beyond the realm of intellectual
   property and includes consumer law, antitrust and competition law. The
   forthcoming EU Digital Services Act aims to revise the regulation of
   online intermediaries by means of new rules framing the responsibilities
   of digital services and online platforms' market behaviour.
   In this context there is no doubt that the current scenario requires
   modern rules. However, it is licit to ask whether and how European
   institutions are considering the collateral effects of the
   above-mentioned tendency. It is also not clear how the basic principles
   underpinning the e-Commerce Directive - and, in particular, freedom of
   expression - will be assured in a new legal framework where online
   intermediaries may not enjoy the safe harbours originally laid down in
   the e-Commerce Directive.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The First Amendment prevents the government from suppressing speech,
   though individuals can ban, chill, or abridge free expression without
   offending the Constitution. Hardly an unintended consequence, Justice
   Oliver Wendell Holmes famously likened free speech to a marketplace
   where the responsibility of rejecting dangerous, repugnant, or worthless
   speech lies with the people. This supposedly maximizes social welfare on
   the theory that the market promotes good ideas and condemns bad ones
   better than the state can. Nevertheless, there is a concern that large
   technology corporations exercise unreasonable power in the marketplace
   of ideas.
   Because ``big tech's{''} ability to abridge speech lacks constitutional
   obstacles, many litigants, politicians, and commentators have recently
   begun to claim that the act of suppressing speech is anticompetitive and
   thus should offend the antitrust laws. Their theory, however, seems
   contrary to antitrust law. Since antitrust is intended to promote
   consumer welfare in commercial markets, antitrust liability is typically
   reserved for firms that have harmed consumers economically. This
   generally requires showing higher prices or restricted output. As such,
   the courts have largely declared that speech entails noncommercial
   activity antitrust has no authority to govern, despite the emergence of
   rhetoric and lawsuits seeking to do just that.
   This Article argues that, contrary to precedent, antitrust law can and
   should promote commercial speech. The economy has evolved such that
   firms and consumers depend on information, ideas, and speech even when
   traded at zero prices known as the ``information economy.{''} In turn,
   technology firms encounter incentives to suppress types of commercial
   speech and, when wielding market power, the ability to do so. For
   example, Apple and Google allegedly bury information, advertising, and
   other forms of commercial expression about rival products to achieve
   anticompetitive ends, harming consumers and markets. This Article
   asserts that in certain instances, enforcement should condemn the
   exclusion of commercial information even when consumers enjoy low prices
   while resisting the emergence of rhetoric calling for the integration of
   all types of speech e.g., expressive, political, and social speech into
   antitrust's framework. If antitrust promoted noncommercial speech, it
   would erode the First Amendment as well as antitrust law.},

Abstract = {2020 will be a landmark year for reasons that had not been anticipated.
   But it is also a critical year for the implementation, by national
   legislators in the European Union, of the ECN+ Directive. This will
   grant competition agencies stronger means of enforcement and will
   consecrate independence of enforcement decisions based on the pursuit of
   consumer welfare protection. Another developing topic in 2020 is
   industrial policy in the EU and its coexistence with competition policy.
   While the EU needs to remain pragmatic, it need not - must not, I would
   argue - lose its distinctive economic features.},

Pages = {391-417},
Abstract = {As other fields of law, competition law is put to the test by new
   technologies in general and algorithmic market activity in particular.
   This article takes a holistic approach by looking at areas of law,
   namely financial regulation and data protection, which have already put
   in place rules and procedures to deal with issues arising from
   algorithms. Before making the bridge and assessing whether the
   application of regulatory tools from these areas might be fruitful for
   competition law as well, the article discusses some recent competition
   cases involving algorithmic market activity. It concludes with policy
   recommendations.},

Title = {European Air Traffic Management from a New Perspective: Competition
   Concerns in the Single European Sky},
Journal = {AIR \& SPACE LAW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {319-355},
Abstract = {This article attempts to assess the Single European Sky (SES) from a
   competition policy and competition law perspective. While air traffic
   management (ATM) has been viewed as a traditional and firm example of
   the exercise of public powers, as a result of technological
   developments, sectoral EU legislation and the relevant activities of the
   European Commission, this assessment may no longer be valid and
   certainly needs to be reconsidered. The European AIM scene is in dynamic
   change, inspired by EU policies and driven by legislative acts. While a
   recent report of the European Court of Auditors highlights several
   problematic aspects of the SES, new European and global markets of ATM
   services emerge, traditional state functions are earmarked for
   privatization, poweOil industrial partnerships try to shape future
   markets, public functions are subjected to industry governance and the
   whole sector is increasingly at risk of technological disruption by tech
   firms such as Google and Facebook, interested in developing automatized
   solutions for the separation of drones and possibly traditional ATM. At
   least some of these new developments may be relevant from the
   competition perspective. It will be argued that competition policy and
   competition law are not only relevant to the ATM sector, but they need
   to be considered when making political and business decisions and
   adopting new legislation. Focussing on the most relevant sectoral
   developments, including provisions of the reinvented SES 2+ sectoral
   legislative proposal of the European Commission, the article will argue
   that overlooking competition policy and competition law in the digital
   SES may lead to anti-competitive consequences in the reorganized ATM
   sector.},

Abstract = {The article offers a new approach and mechanism for managing of
   competitive advantages at the mesolevel by harmonization the competition
   and industrial policies.
   The structural model of the fifteen-component eight-level concept of
   competition and industrial policies harmonization is presented, on the
   basis of which the algorithm of competition and industrial policies
   harmonization based on labor productivity is made. By this algorithm, as
   a result of combined comparative assessment on the synchronous
   indicators of labor productivity, eight standard strategies and also
   recommendations for the formation of new strategies are developed.
   New groups of indicators are presented - ``synchronous indicators{''} of
   competition and industrial policies, allowing to monitor the
   simultaneous implementation of both policies, ``specific indicators{''}
   that can only be used to assessment competition or exclusively
   industrial policy and ``combined indicators{''} of competition and
   industrial policies, which are become by uniting the above-stated
   specific indicators. The method of this indicators calculation is
   developed.},

Year = {2005},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Pages = {343-361},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The browser wars case is a useful springboard for considering the
   principle of positive competition and the proper regulation of platform
   technologies. There are lessons to be culled about policy, the
   application of antitrust law, and the parameters of fair competition. We
   argue that despite Microsofts opportunistic exploitation of its
   proprietary code, policy makers should resist the temptation to mandate
   an open source code model. Vigilant anti-trust enforcement is a
   preferable alternative. But courts must refrain from using antitrust law
   to favor small innovators or to constrain the economic protections
   inherent in intellectual property rights, since those rights are still
   needed to encourage innovation. On the other hand, despite the
   exigencies of competition, platform leaders should respect the norm of
   fair competition and refrain from the impulse to tilt the platform in
   their favor. Preservation of robust intellectual property rights, deft
   application of antitrust statutes, and principled competition represent
   the best prescription for social wealth in the New Economy.},

Abstract = {Motivated by their increasing prevalence, we study outcomes when
   competing sellers use machine learning algorithms to run real-time
   dynamic price experiments. These algorithms are often misspecified,
   ignoring the effect of factors outside their control, for example,
   competitors' prices. We show that the long-run prices depend on the
   informational value (or signal-to-noise ratio) of price experiments: if
   low, the long-run prices are consistent with the static Nash equilibrium
   of the corresponding full information setting. However, if high, the
   long-run prices are supra-competitive-the full information joint
   monopoly outcome is possible. We show that this occurs via a novel
   channel: competitors' algorithms' prices end up running correlated
   experiments. Therefore, sellers' misspecified models overestimate the
   own price sensitivity, resulting in higher prices. We discuss the
   implications on competition policy.},

Abstract = {This article analyzes the scope of out-of-market efficiencies in
   competition policy from a legal and economic perspective. It identifies
   potential shortcomings in neglecting their relevance, both in relation
   to the economic principles of two-sided platforms and, more generally,
   in the fulfillment of the consumer welfare standard. This article
   tackles this issue by looking at the specific condition laid out in
   Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
   requiring that a fair share of efficiency benefits must be passed on to
   consumers in order to justify an otherwise anticompetitive agreement.
   The implications of forbidding or allowing aggregation of efficiencies
   across markets are examined with reference to the two-sided market of
   payment card systems and the anticompetitive concerns regarding
   Multilateral Interchange Fees.},

   {[}Anonymous], The term killer acquisitions has been borrowed from the pharmaceutical industry, indicating an incumbent that acquires a potential competitor with an innovative project that is still at an early stage of its development and subsequently terminates the development of the target's innovation in order to avoid a substitution effect, pre-empting competition from innovating firms that potentially threaten its core market position. In so-called killer acquisitions, not only is there a loss of the competitive constraint posed by the acquired start.

Abstract = {ICT-based standards can enable and enhance interoperability and
   compatibility and decrease transaction costs in the ICT-driven
   marketplace. World trade would not be prosperous today but for the rapid
   modern development of ICT-based industries across the globe. Nowadays,
   most technical standards in the ICT-based industries are covered by
   patents, and controversies over standard essential patents and FRAND
   licensing have been disrupting global ICT-based industries and
   corresponding trade flows. Current dis-pute settlement mechanisms for
   resolving ex-post FRAND-rate disputes generally fall into two
   categories: adjudication by national courts and certain types of
   arbitration. Yet they are neither adequate nor satisfactory. In the
   meantime, to a certain degree, it seems impracticable to count on the
   approach of patent policy clarifications by SDOs to clinch currently
   escalating FRAND-based disputes as well. In short, there presently seem
   to be no quick fixes. In contrast, international public governance may
   better serve the goal of progressively resolving costly FRAND-based
   disputes in the long run. Specifi-cally in the context of world trade, a
   plurilateral SEP-related competition agreement might be relatively
   achievable. Meanwhile, in combination with and complementing other
   existing and proposed means, this agreement is likely to be an integral
   part of the multi-factor solution toolkit for resolving costly and
   disruptive FRAND-based dis-putes across the globe. For one thing, it
   could help alleviate the on-going escalating FRAND-based disputes per
   se; for another, such an initiative might instil new momen-tum into the
   multilateral trading system, which is struggling through a variety of
   institu-tional difficulties.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to shed light on the economic tools, as well as the
   legal-economic reasoning, which are used by different European antitrust
   authorities to assess the allegedly anticompetitive practices of a
   platform operating in a two-sided market (2SM). First of all, we show
   that despite the flourishing literature on 2SM economics, antitrust
   authorities are still facing major challenges when taking decisions
   concerning two-sided platforms (2SPs). Secondly, we perform a
   cross-country, comparative study of recent competition proceedings
   towards the 2SP Booking.com and highlight conceptual and practical
   divergences among antitrust authorities which are bound by and applying
   a common European legislation. By concretely and thoroughly showing
   where the differences lie, our study contributes to identifying the
   issues to tackle to ensure a better harmonized implementation of
   measures towards 2SPs at the EU level. Finally, building on the results
   of our work, we propose some alternative approaches which could benefit
   future antitrust analyses in 2SMs.},

Abstract = {This paper characterises the conventional and the digital sector of the
   EU economy since the late 90s and introduces a two sector growth model
   which highlights structural differences between the two sectors. In
   contrast to conventional goods and services, digital goods and services
   are more easily scalable but require more upfront intangible investment.
   These features require consideration of fixed costs and a departure from
   perfect competition and raise issues about market entry. Another
   important dimension is the skill demand of both sectors, with the latter
   requiring a larger share of workers with digital skills. Since COVID-19
   is expected to induce a persistent increase of demand for digital
   services, we use this model to estimate the likely economic impacts. We
   are in particular interested how the digital transition is affecting the
   labour market and the functional distribution of income. The paper shows
   how the distribution of economic rents between workers with digital
   skills and platforms is determined by labour supply conditions and entry
   barriers. This suggests that there is a role for competition policy and
   labour market policies to support the digital transition.},

Abstract = {The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) is a recently-formed division
   of the Patent Office in which patents can be challenged as invalid, and
   which differs from federal courts in a number of respects. We
   investigate whether monopolist-patentees and their prospective rivals
   are using the PTAB which has not previously received antitrust attention
   as a platform for striking settlements that delay the rivals' entry.
   Such settlements are common in pharmaceutical markets, and are typically
   antitrust violations in cases where the patentee pays the challenger
   ({''}pay for delay{''}). However, problematic statutory inducements lead
   to excessively-delayed competition even in lieu of such payments. Our
   empirical findings suggest that delayed entry settlements are now
   commonly executed in the PTAB, and that they comprise a large majority
   of all PTAB settlements reached between pharmaceutical rivals. Further,
   nearly half of the delayed entry settlements were reached after the
   relevant patent claims were deemed ``reasonably likely{''} to be
   invalid. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Online economic interactions generate data that artificial intelligence
   (AI), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can use: business
   predictive analytics, process optimisation and market power; consumer
   search and choice; and government gathering evidence and regulating
   harmful behaviour. In algorithmic collusion (AC), revenue management
   algorithms implement tacitly collusive behaviour. This paper summarises
   theoretical and empirical evidence and considers how ML methods affect
   AC and whether regulators' algorithms can help. It examines links
   between Internet regulation and competition policy.
   Early ML literature concerned programmes `learning' their environments,
   e.g. predicting rivals' prices to maximise profit by estimating
   prices/costs, identifying strategies or influencing learning. Here, ML
   is AI that self-programs to optimise specific objectives (data and model
   `layers') and DL is many-layered ML. Increased depth makes behaviour an
   intricate convolution of data and programme history; invisible to
   programmers and inexplicable to others. ML by many firms may fail to
   converge or have unintended consequences.
   Many models use simple ML algorithms to demonstrate behaviour consistent
   with collusion. It is not classically collusive without communication.
   Populations of simple AI can learn reward/punishment strategies that
   sustain profitable outcomes. This paper considers further variations
   taking into account strategic variations, finite-memory or dominance
   elimination and the impact of product characteristics and search.
   Simulation illustrates classic inefficiencies (overshoot, convergence to
   supracompetitive prices, cycles and endogenous marketsharing).
   It is not clear what regulators could or should ban; can they detect AC
   or limit its consequences? We consider: restricting information
   available to firms; constraining price dynamics; coding standards that
   incorporate regulatory compliance in ML objectives; and algorithmic
   detection of specified anticompetitive behaviours. For instance,
   likelihood-ratio policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms are
   more likely to converge to collusive behaviours when they take other
   firms' learning into account and able to shape others' learning with
   suitable prevalence of AI and network topology.},

Abstract = {Advances in technology are creating new business models. The internet
   means that consumers can access a wide variety of potential suppliers.
   Those suppliers may have extensive data on individual consumers, and the
   interactions between buyers and sellers may be moderated by large,
   potentially dominant, platforms such as Google and Facebook. Competition
   authorities and policy makers are grappling with the issues raised by
   technology. However, the tools available to regulators are often laws
   that were designed for a pre-internet world. It is not clear if these
   laws can adapt. This article briefly surveys three areas of particular
   concern for both economic researchers and competition authorities: the
   competitive implications of two-sided markets; price restrictions
   imposed by internet platforms on retailers; and the use of personalized
   data by sellers.},

Abstract = {How to compete successfully in an online environment raises numerous
   issues for both small and medium enterprises2 (SMEs) and regulatory
   agencies. This paper considers these matters at two different levels:
   the macro-scale (how markets are structured and operate; access to
   electronic infrastructure; resale price maintenance activities, and
   market mergers), and the micro (how individual firms operate and
   interact with their customers, competitors and suppliers). Each of these
   issues is examined, with a special focus on regulatory activity in the
   Australian competition and consumer law arena to deal with such matters.
   Some observations are also made on certain unexpected by-products of the
   electronic commerce: the growing incidence of scams perpetrated against
   SMEs; the likely continuing rise of the informal sector; and potential
   changes to conventional franchising models. Finally, the way in which
   regulatory agencies respond to all these matters is discussed.},

Abstract = {In the era of big data, the scale and market power of internet brokers
   companies have gotten the significant improvement. After accepting the
   information display, comparative evaluation and consumption
   recommendation in shopping, dining, tourism and other fields provided by
   big data brokers, consumers fully felt the qualitative leap in the
   efficiency of consumption behavior under the digital economy. But at the
   same time, when faced with the dominance of big data brokers, the
   traditional weak consumers do not really improve the ability of informed
   and rational decision-making. On the contrary, there is the possibility
   that big data brokers mislead the consumers and exploit the interests of
   consumers, and the overall market competition order also have the great
   risk of being destroyed by the anti-competitive behaviors of big data
   brokers. Regulators and legislators should begin to develop consumer
   protection strategies against the strong growth for big data brokers.
   That is, to establish a balance mechanism of consumer personal
   information control and data disclosure; to full play the regulatory
   role of competition policy; to build a legal system of big data
   regulation. These strategies together achieve the strict supervision to
   big data brokers, and to complete the legal protection of consumer
   welfare.},

   showrooming by depriving the supplier of the right to offer lower rates
   on its own website than on the platform. In recent years, some EC
   countries have banned such agreements. It was justified by the perceived
   benefits of increased vertical competition between suppliers and
   platforms acting as their distributors. The paper considers the
   interaction between the supplier and a platform like Booking.com , in
   the presence of narrow price parity clauses and without them. It is
   shown that the bans of such agreements may have long-run consequences
   radically different from the original intentions of the regulator. The
   reason for this is the reaction of the platform suppressing vertical
   competition by intensifying competition between the former and the newly
   attracted suppliers (apartment owners). The resulting uberization of the
   industry complicates the traditional suppliers (hotels) reproduction
   processes and negatively affects the welfare of consumers. The
   inefficiency of the existing regulatory regime of digital multi-sided
   markets leading to concentration of revenues in the hands of transaction
   platforms suggest that there is an urgent need to form national
   platforms, whose function should be to support domestic suppliers,
   create industry infrastructure, etc...},

Abstract = {Trust-busting is once again a subject of national attention. And the
   attention is well-deserved: unprecedented levels of corporate
   concentration, firm dominance, and inequality demand robust debate about
   how antitrust solutions can ensure that our economy works for everyone.
   One simple remedy to ``bigness{''} has stolen the spotlight within that
   debate- ``breaking up{''} big firms into smaller ones to decrease
   corporate power and lower prices. But calls to break up firms from Big
   Tech to Big Ag have focused on how breakups could benefit consumers and,
   in some cases, small businesses. Absent from these debates is how
   breakups benefit or harm the workers and labor markets affected by firm
   dismantling.
   This Article is the first to focus on how firm breakups-and antitrust
   enforcement and remedial design more generally -can and have
   significantly impacted workers' countervailing power and earning
   potential. Firm structure matters for worker power. Dismantling dominant
   firms can result in more firms competing for workers' services, which
   can lift worker wages. But it can also dismantle structures of worker
   power that have arisen to successfully counter dominant employers. A
   leading example, as this Article documents, is the devastating effect of
   the 1980s breakup of the Bell System on the Communications Workers of
   America, gutting union density within the telecommunications industry
   from 56 percent prebreakup to 24 percent by 2001. Breakups, much like
   workplace ``fissuring,{''} can decimate labor market institutions that
   advocate on workers' behalf but also have and can result in layoffs,
   increased obstacles for worker coordination, lower overall wage rates,
   and dramatic reductions in earned benefits, job security, and the
   quality of working conditions.
   The Article fills the gap in antitrust scholarship and policy debates
   that have ignored the effects of antitrust remedies on workers. It
   offers the first comprehensive scholarly treatment of these effects and
   argues that, for historical, theoretical, and empirical reasons,
   antitrust enforcers and scholars must attune their prescriptions and
   remedial mechanisms to ensure that antitrust remedies do not perpetuate
   the long history of antitrust law's alternating hostility to or
   disregard for worker welfare. It begins by summarizing the debates
   around firm breakups and reveals their disregard for labor market
   competition and worker welfare. It then unearths case studies and social
   scientific analyses to assess the effects of breakups and offers a
   theoretical and empirical overview of when breaking up firms can benefit
   or harm labor market competition and workers' countervailing power
   against dominant employers. It concludes by proposing alternative
   remedies to monopolization and corporate consolidation that better
   secure worker welfare.},

Abstract = {The Taiwan-Philips case concerns the legitimacy of Taiwan's granting of
   compulsory licenses at issue, the consistency of the Patent Act of
   Taiwan with the TRIPS Agreement, and Philips alleged anti-competitive
   practices regarding its exploitation of patents. This case is of
   extraordinary importance in Taiwan with respect both to Patent Act and
   Fair Trade Act. Similarly, it reminds us a number of issues regarding
   IPRs protection and competition maintenance under the multilateral
   framework. This article discusses the consistency of Article 76(l) of
   Taiwan's Patent Act with the TRIPS Agreement and the role
   competition-related Moreover the author seeks to make the case that the
   TRIPS Agreement has created a platform from which further efforts to
   expand and strengthen the multilateral regulatory competition regime can
   be developed alongside the evolving framework of the WTO. With a focus
   on the relationship between competition and IPRs, this article proposes
   a two-track approach as a possible alternative for the stymied
   negotiations on competition policy under the WTO framework.},

Abstract = {The article analyzes difficulties in the design and implementation of
   pro-competition and universal services policies in Mexico, from the
   privatization of the public telephone company in 1990 to the recently
   approved Telecommunications and Broadcasting Reform of 2013-2014. It
   reviews recent literature on the expansion of Mexico's
   telecommunications infrastructure, formulates its conceptual framework
   based on institutional theory, and proposes possible explanations for
   Mexico's underperformance. Finally, it addresses the reforms of 2014,
   concluding that the new institutional embodiment of these reforms has
   begun to bear fruit: Telecommunication markets have seen a rise in their
   contestability, attributable to the institutional strength of the new
   regulatory framework. On digital inclusion, the deployment of two
   wholesale networks is on schedule. The Mexico Connected program has led
   to a 500\% increase in Internet access points in public places. But
   there little information on whether these access points are equipped
   with the necessary infrastructure and personnel for developing digital
   skills to foster the adoption of such technologies},

Abstract = {This article is set against the Court of Justice of the European Union's
   (CJEU) decisions in Pierre Fabre and Coty Germany GmbH, observing that
   in the digital economy, price is no longer the sole important parameter
   of competition and that competition law therefore has to reconstruct the
   theoretical background required to explain the tensions contained in the
   design of concentrated marketplaces. As the CJEU's approach taken in
   Pierre Fabre and Coty shows, competition authorities and courts also
   need to consider the market's distinct psychological properties when
   they contemplate the legal framework that governs it. The article thus
   explains the CJEU's decisions not against the well-known debate about
   inter- and intrabrand competition but with reference to the notion of
   creating distinct types of `variety' in the marketplace so as to enable
   consumers to choose not just between the alternative options that they
   face but also to enable them to make decisions that will shape the
   manner in which they think about whether they should consider
   alternative options at all. The article's findings aim to advance
   debates about the overarching policy goals of the way in which digital
   markets ought to be regulated.},

Abstract = {The early phase of diffusion plays a critical role in determining
   information technology (IT) success in a market. Takeoff, the transition
   point from the introduction to the growth phase in the IT life cycle, is
   viewed as an add test for whether a technology will succeed. We develop
   a theory to understand global takeoff for digital wireless phones that
   can be extended to other technologies with related characteristics.
   Drawing on technology dominance and product life cycle theories, we
   build a model that consists of standards, market competition, technology
   costs, and technology substitution to explain takeoff and subsequent
   market penetration growth. The data are from 41 developed and developing
   countries. The results suggest that the presence and effects of
   standards play an important role in driving takeoff and penetration
   growth. Familiarity with wireless phones and an installed base of analog
   phone technologies also explain faster takeoff times. Non-price factors
   are important drivers of penetration growth after takeoff as well. Our
   results have managerial and policy implications on innovative
   strategies, standards and competition policy settings for digital
   wireless phones. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {``Paperless Ticketing{''} refers to a transaction where the purchaser
   uses her credit card to get into an event instead of having a ticket,
   pdf, or mobile phone scanable file. As implemented by TicketMaster, the
   secondary or resale market of tickets originally sold by TicketMaster
   must go through TicketMasters own resale site, TicketExchange (or its
   wholly owned sister site, TicketsNow). Preventing other platforms like
   StubHub, RazorGator, and the like from being used severely limits the
   resale market. In an empirical study of over 1,600 tickets, some sold as
   Paperless Ticketing tickets and others sold as conventional tickets, the
   price in the secondary market for the Paperless Ticketing tickets was
   nearly \$100 higher than comparable conventional tickets sold. In
   addition, the quantity of Paperless Ticketing tickets available and sold
   in the secondary market relative to comparable conventional tickets was
   about 10 percent. In other words, the supply of Paperless Ticketing
   tickets available for sale in the secondary market was much lower and
   the prices were much higher. This is consistent with the theoretical
   findings, and standard economics findings, of downstream attempted
   monopolization by an upstream supplier.},

Abstract = {Probably not, is the short answer to that question. Unlike other
   platforms, such as operating systems, credit cards, or even nightclubs,
   where a single transaction is performed via the platform, two different
   transactions take place on Google. Users perform searches in exchange
   for personal data, while advertisers seek users attentionuto be matched
   with the right user. Whereas operating systems, credit cards, and
   nightclubs would cease to exist if either of the two sides were missing,
   search engines (rather like TV or newspapers) can exist under different
   market configurations. Indeed, in search engines, network externalities
   run only from the number of users to advertisers, not the other way
   around. Building upon this analysis, a non-bilateral construction of the
   relevant market where Google operates is proposed. Google operates as a
   retailer of users personal information. In the upstream market, it buys
   users personal information from large retailers and final consumers in
   exchange for search services, or upon monetary payment. It then uses the
   personal information collected to sell targeted advertising to
   advertisers in the downstream market. Based on this market construction,
   the allegations against Google are analyzed as alleged violations of
   competition law along this vertical chain.},

Abstract = {We study the price and welfare effects of collusion between two-sided
   platforms and show that they depend on whether collusion occurs on both
   sides or a single side of the market, and whether users single-home or
   multi-home. Our most striking result is that one-sided collusion leads
   to lower (resp. higher) prices on the collusive (resp. competitive) side
   if the cross-group externalities exerted on the collusive side are
   positive and sufficiently strong. One-sided collusion may, therefore,
   benefit the users on the collusive side and harm the users on the
   competitive side. Our findings have implications regarding cartel
   detection and damages actions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {We describe three interesting cases that the UK Competition and Markets
   Authority (CMA) has dealt with over the past year: first, we discuss the
   merger of two online food ordering platformsJust Eat and
   Hungryhousewhich required an assessment of competition in the presence
   of indirect network effects. Second, we discuss the vertical merger of a
   grocery retailer and wholesalerTesco and Bookerwhich posed the challenge
   of how to assess a firm's incentives to foreclose its rivals when there
   are thousands of local markets. Finally, we discuss Open Banking, which
   lies at the heart of the package of remedies that came out of the CMA's
   market investigation into personal banking, and sought to tackle issues
   of low customer engagement.},

Abstract = {The Department of Justice recent case against Microsoft is that it
   should not be allowed to aggressively maintain control over the internet
   browser market with the objective of preventing the internet from
   becoming the platform that could ultimately destroy Microsoft's
   operating system market. The aim of this paper is not to attack the
   Department of Justice case. Rather, it is to argue that for consumers
   one monopoly dominating both the operating system and applications is
   better than two separate monopolies. In our model we integrate Cournot's
   theory of two goods that are jointly used in the production of a third
   composite good with the fixed-proportion model. Utilizing our model we
   develop a possible explanation for Microsoft's actions - protection of
   its monopoly profits in the operating systems package market.
   Additionally we show that the price of the final product is lower if one
   firm monopolizes all markets. Consequently, the ordered split-up of
   Microsoft by Judge Thomas P. Jackson, aiming at creating two separate
   companies, one that will produce the windows and the other the operating
   systems, will harm consumers.},

Abstract = {The menace of cyber attacks has become a concern for both the public and
   private sectors. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle the
   challenge, but an approach that has received widespread acceptance among
   cyber security professionals in both public and private sectors is cyber
   threat information (CTI) sharing. CTI refers to any information that can
   help an organisation identify, assess, monitor and respond to cyber
   threats. It includes indicators of compromise; tactics, techniques and
   procedures used by threat actors; suggested actions to detect, contain,
   or prevent attacks; and the findings from the analyses of incidents.
   Sharing CTI has been proposed as an efficient and effective way of
   improving overall cyber intelligence and defence. However, there are
   sources of liability that may dissuade private entities from
   participating in such sharing. The most cited source of liability is
   privacy and data protection law; although antitrust law, tort of
   negligence law and intellectual property law are also cited as potential
   sources of liability. In this study, we review the extent to which the
   provisions of privacy and data protection law support or refute the
   sharing of CTI. This will provide guidance and incentives for private
   entities willing to participate in CTI sharing, especially for critical
   infrastructure protection.},

Title = {HOW MUCH EFFECTIVENESS FOR THE EU DAMAGES DIRECTIVE? CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES

Journal = {COMMON MARKET LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {433-474},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Damages Directive is celebrated as a milestone for private
   enforcement of EU competition law; it harmonizes national procedural
   laws and aims to facilitate full compensation for damages resulting from
   competition law violations. Businesses frequently use contractual
   clauses that might present obstacles in obtaining compensation. Recent
   examples include a US case against Uber which was inadmissible because o
   f clauses in the app's terms and conditions; and clauses included in
   Ryanair's terms and conditions. This paper explores the extent to which
   clauses on jurisdiction, mandatory arbitration, and those preventing
   participation in class actions endanger the Directive's effectiveness.
   It shows that, in contrast to consumer situations, such dangers do exist
   in commercial cases. It suggests a balancing exercise between party
   autonomy and full effectiveness of victims' rights. The principle of
   effectiveness provides some protection, but these dangers to the
   development of a strong private enforcement are likely to remain in the
   future and suggest renewed attention for private enforcement.},

Abstract = {The aim of the research is to identify the patterns and role of state
   monopoly policies in the development of Chinese state and society. It
   provides a comparative analysis of the Chinese government's policy in
   the field of monopolies in history and at the present stage.
   State monopolies have played an important role and have had significant
   political and economic influence throughout history in China. One of the
   China's monopolies which has a great influence on the high-tech
   production market is the monopoly on rare earth metals (REM). Control
   over this market increases the dependence of other countries on China
   and allows the use of this dependence in foreign policy processes. The
   second monopoly, Panda monopoly, is also used as an instrument of
   foreign policy to express friendly intentions and willingness to
   cooperate. Along with this, a number of monopolies are undergoing
   transformational processes in China. For example, one of the oldest
   monopolies in the world - the monopoly of China on salt - was dismantled
   in 2017, the Chinese government is preparing to abolish the state
   monopoly on oil and gas mining and production in 2020.
   The Internet market trends discussed in the article indicate the
   presence of monopolies in the Internet space and the need to build new
   antitrust policy in the digital sphere.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT},
Abstract = {While business users face difficulties accessing and porting data on
   platforms, the Digital Markets Act has been hailed as the legislative
   tool enabling business users access and transfer the data they have
   generated on platforms controlled by gatekeepers. The tool provided by
   the Digital Markets Act is discussed in this article and the author
   argue that business users should have a more elaborated right to first
   access the data they produce on platforms and in ecosystems, and
   secondly transfer such data from platform to platform, cloud to cloud,
   thing to thing or in-house. A right to access and transfer data could
   have several benefits; it benefits dissemination of data, creativity and
   innovation in connected markets and it promotes competition between
   platforms, clouds and ecosystem providers. Creativity will be enhanced
   because necessary data-being the raw material for new innovations-will
   be more broadly disbursed. It will also benefit consumers having a
   disbursed and disseminated data commons for the development of ideas,
   innovations, and the exchange of knowledge.},

Abstract = {A vertical most-favored-nation (vMFN) restraint prohibits a retailer
   from charging more for one supplier's product than for rivals' products.
   For credit card services, this restraint takes the form of a
   no-surcharge rule: the credit card company prohibits the retailer from
   surcharging transactions using the company's card. This article develops
   a theory of vMFN restraints and applies it to credit cards. The vMFN
   clause harms competition among upstream suppliers, which raises price to
   a level even greater than the monopoly price. The vMFN clause can also
   be used to extract surplus from customers of products supplied
   competitively. Applying the theory to credit card antitrust cases, we
   find that the two-sided nature of the market does not mandate a new set
   of competition policy principles, contrary to the decision in Ohio v.
   American Express. Indeed, the economic literature on credit card
   networks as two-sided platforms rediscovers established principles of
   price theory.},

Title = {Monopoly Pricing of Social Goods},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF BUSINESS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Pages = {429-448},
Abstract = {We analyse the roles of network connectivity and topology on the
   monopoly pricing of network goods which enable social interaction
   between consumers. Connectivity between network members induces the
   well-known network externalities effect, while the topological effect is
   caused by the incompleteness of the social network's linkage, and it has
   not been previously recognised in this context. We find that the
   topological effect counteracts, and dominates, the connectivity effect
   by reducing the monopoly's capacity to extract consumer surplus. Our
   results are seen to hold in real cases of social network businesses. The
   monopolist benefits from price discrimination based on consumers' social
   connections, but this has a social cost as consumer surplus loss is
   higher than the increase in profits, with the highly connected consumers
   being the primary losers. Therefore, privacy policies restricting
   excessive social profiling and tracking can have an antitrust role too.
   Our approach also extends the theory of multi-sided markets in relation
   to the underlying relations graph of different market sides.},

Abstract = {This article analyses the Mandatory Bargaining Code that the Australian
   Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has proposed to give
   Australian media businesses the ability to bargain with Google and
   Facebook to secure fair payment for news content. Under the ACCC's Code,
   if an Australian news business fails to reach an agreement with Google
   or Facebook through negotiation or mediation, the news business will
   have the right to commence a 45-day compulsory ``Final Offer
   Arbitration{''} process to determine the remuneration that Google or
   Facebook must pay for the use of its news content. The article focuses
   on the practical and legal issues that may arise from the use of Final
   Offer Arbitration to resolve disputes, including whether the arbitration
   process prescribed by the Code falls within the scope of Australia's
   arbitration legislation and the extent to which determinations made by
   arbitrators under the Code will be subject to any form of appeal.},

Title = {Liability for Data Scraping Prohibitions under the Refusal to Deal
   Doctrine: An Incremental Step toward More Robust Sherman Act Enforcement},
Journal = {UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {86},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1901-1940},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The digital economy has become increasingly consolidated in recent years
   as a handful of companies (namely Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and
   Amazon) have come to dominate every corner of the internet. Several of
   these companies have attained such size and influence that labelling
   them monopolists seems unavoidable. These companies have reinvigorated
   the debate regarding how antitrust law should treat monopolists. Many
   scholars, typically associated with the Chicago School of antitrust,
   believe that courts should hesitate before taking action against
   internet monopolists because judicial intervention may discourage
   investment in the digital economy without benefiting consumers. Critics
   of the Chicago School meanwhile argue that internet monopolists pose a
   unique threat to competition by virtue of their control of
   user-generated data.
   This Comment argues that monopolists' ability to restrict data access
   poses a grave and novel threat to competition. Two recent cases, hiQ
   Labs, Inc v LinkedIn Corp and Authenticom, Inc v CDK Global LLC,
   highlight the risk of dominant internet companies prohibiting public
   data scraping to quash competitors and cement their monopolies. This
   Comment argues that courts should apply the Sherman Act ``refusal to
   deal{''} doctrine to proscribe public data scraping prohibitions under
   specific circumstances. Applying refusal to deal liability to scraping
   prohibitions would create a more dynamic and open digital economy. It
   would also be an incremental expansion of antitrust liability, which
   would not dissuade digital investment or otherwise cause massive
   economic disruption. Finding refusal to deal liability for data scraping
   prohibitions would therefore allow courts to employ their common law
   process and adapt the Sherman Act to meet new competitive challenges in
   the digital economy.},

Title = {Making Innovation More Competitive: The Case of Fintech},
Journal = {UCLA LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {232-279},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Finance startups are offering automated advice, touchless payments, and
   other products that could bring great societal benefits, induding lower
   prices and expanded access to credit. Yet unlike in other digital arenas
   in which American companies are global leaders, such as search engines
   and ride hailing, the United States lags in consumer financial
   technology. This Article posits that the current competition policy
   framework is holding back consumer financial innovation. It then
   identifies a contributor missing from the literature: the institutional
   design of federal regulators. Competition authority including antitrust
   and the extension of business licenses is spread across at least five
   agencies. Each is focused on other missions or industries. The
   Department of Justice (DOJ), hindered by statutes and knowledge gaps,
   devotes significantly fewer resources to banking than to other
   industries in merger review because it leans heavily on prudential
   regulators. The Federal Reserve and other prudential regulators
   prioritize financial stability, which conflicts with their competition
   mandate. No agency has the right authority, motivation, and expertise to
   promote consumer financial competition.
   Innovation has raised the stakes for fixing this structural flaw in
   finance, and potentially in other heavily regulated industries. If
   allowed to compete fully, financial technology challengers
   ({''}fintechs{''}) could bring large consumer welfare advances and
   reduce the size of ``Too Big to Fail{''} banks, thereby lessening the
   chances of a financial crisis. If allowed to grow unchecked, fintechs or
   the big banks acquiring them may reach the kind of digital market
   dominance seen in Google, Facebook, and Amazon, thereby increasing
   systemic risk. Whether the goal is to benefit consumers, strengthen
   markets, or prevent crises, a reallocation of competition authority
   would better position regulators to navigate the future of innovation.},

Abstract = {Third-party networks collect vast amounts of data about users via
   websites and mobile applications. Consolidations among tracker companies
   can significantly increase their individual tracking capabilities,
   prompting scrutiny by competition regulators. Traditional measures of
   market share, based on revenue or sales, fail to represent the tracking
   capability of a tracker, especially if it spans both web and mobile.
   This article proposes a new approach to measure the concentration of
   tracking capability, based on the reach of a tracker on popular websites
   and apps. Our results reveal that tracker prominence and
   parent-subsidiary relationships have significant impact on accurately
   measuring concentration.},

Abstract = {The National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 (NCRA) facilitated the
   creation of joint research and development ventures in the United States
   by diminishing the threat of antitrust litigation for selected
   cooperative research activities. This law enabled U.S. industry to move
   from a strictly competitive model to a more cooperative model in the
   development of new technologies, including those for electronic media.
   One of the early tests of this new cooperative model has been the
   formation of several high definition television (HDTV) research
   consortia. This study investigates the impact of the NCRA on advanced
   television research and development efforts in the U.S., and concludes
   with policy recommendations for future refinement of the cooperative
   research model.},

Abstract = {The dynamic development of digital technologies favours the rapid
   increase the popularity of electronic commerce, but at the same time
   causes an ever-stronger competitive pressure, prompting manufacturers
   and wholesalers to use various tools for controlling the sales system,
   especially prices. They often impose various restrictions on commercial
   partners (e.g. distributors) by preventing them from using certain sales
   channels. However, it is difficult to delimit the legality of such sales
   restrictions. It is very difficult to find an answer to the question of
   where the appropriate demarcation line should be drawn that determines
   the violation of competition rules, especially in online sales.
   Regulation 330/2010 seems not to be tailored to the assessment of
   restrictions in online distribution channels. The aim of the article is
   to point out the lack of appropriate tools to assess the restrictions of
   internet sales. The article shows that there is currently no uniform
   approach by antitrust authorities, which in turn results in legal
   uncertainty. It seems that the amendment of Regulation 330/2010 should
   be considered and the market share threshold set out in it should be
   lowered, while at the same time ensuring that it will be an actual safe
   harbour for companies, including online distributors.},

Abstract = {Intel, a US-based company, was fined by the European Commission in 2009
   for abusing its dominant position at the computer processor market
   intended to exclude its competitor AMD from that market. The penalty
   amounting to (sic)1.06bn was the largest antitrust fine in the
   Commission's history at the time. As the EU General Court had rejected
   Intel's appeal in 2014, the matter was brought before to EU Court of
   Justice. The CJEU judgment, rendered in September 2017, is controversial
   for at least two reasons. First is the territorial reach of the EU
   competition law outside the EU borders, and second relates to the
   treatment of exclusivity rebates. With regards to the former, for the
   first time the CJEU confirmed the position of the Commission and the
   General Court regarding the extended territorial reach of the EU
   antitrust legislation. Quite the opposite, the CJEU quashed the General
   Court ruling as to the former, arguably rejecting the traditional per se
   infringement of exclusivity rebates and embracing the effects-based
   analysis. The doctrine is somewhat divided as to whether this judgment
   is a much needed clarification of the two issues or it indicates a new
   direction in EU competition law analysis. This paper is addressing the
   most important ideas in the doctrinal interpretations and related
   arguments, and provides critical assessment of the present state of
   affairs. It also raises certain points relevant to the Intel judgment,
   which so far have not been given sufficient attention in the case
   comments and scholarship.},

Journal = {NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW},

Abstract = {The information that we reveal from interactions online and with
   electronic devices has massive value-for both private profit and public
   benefit, such as improving health, safety, and even commute times. Who
   owns the lucrative big data that we generate through the everyday
   necessity of interacting with technology? Calls for legal regulation
   regarding how companies use our data have spurred laws and proposals
   framed by the predominant lens of individual privacy and the right to
   control and delete data about oneself. By focusing on individual control
   over droplets of personal data, the major consumer privacy regimes
   overlook the important question of rights in the big data ocean.
   This Article is the first to frame a right of the public to benefit from
   our consumer big data. Drawing on insights from property theory,
   regulatory advances, and open innovation, the Article introduces a model
   that permits controlled access and the use of big data for public
   interest purposes while protecting against privacy harms, among others.
   I propose defining a right of access to pooled personal data for public
   purposes, with sensitive information safeguarded by a controlled-access
   procedure akin to that used by institutional review boards in medical
   research today. To encourage companies to voluntarily share data for
   public interest purposes, the Article also proposes regulatory sandboxes
   and safe harbors akin to those successfully deployed in other domains,
   such as antitrust, financial technology, and intellectual property law.},

Abstract = {Nowhere has financial technology or ``fintech{''} become larger or as
   transformative as in China. Fintech, largely developed by technology
   companies, rapidly turned China from a largely cash-based, backward
   financial system to a fintech leader globally. At the same time, China's
   government created an environment conducive to innovation. China's
   experience with fintech is a rich repository of lessons for other
   countries aiming to modernize their financial service industries and
   ``leapfrog{''} up to advanced economies in some respects. It shows how
   clever reforms can overcome the lack of competition for financial
   incumbents, but also the mechanisms necessary to ensure regulation and
   supervision are sufficient for the risks of financial innovation.
   Finally, policy debates and solutions in China around the power of big
   tech, including in finance, have relevance to a world increasingly
   forced to grapple with these issues.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {There is growing evidence that tacit collusion can be autonomously
   achieved by machine learning technology, at least in some real-life
   examples identified in the literature and experimental settings.
   Although more work needs to be done to assess the competitive risks of
   widespread adoption of autonomous pricing agents, this is still an
   appropriate time to examine which possible remedies can be used in case
   competition law shifts towards the prohibition of tacit collusion. This
   is because outlawing such conduct is pointless unless there are suitable
   remedies that can be used to address the social harm. This article
   explores how fines and structural and behavioural remedies can serve to
   discourage collusive results while preserving the incentives to use
   efficiency-enhancing algorithms. We find that this could be achieved if
   fines and remedies can target structural conditions that facilitate
   collusion. In addition, the problem of unfeasibility of injunctions to
   remedy traditional price coordination changes with the use of pricing
   software, which in theory can be programmed to avoid collusive outcomes.
   Finally, machine-learning methods can be used by the authorities
   themselves as a tool to test the effects of any given combination of
   remedies and to estimate a more accurate competitive benchmark for the
   calculation of the appropriate fine.},

Title = {VERTICAL RESTRAINTS ON E-COMMERCE AND SELECTIVE DISTRIBUTION},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {747-773},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper discusses whether, when manufacturers choose to adopt a
   selective distribution system, vertical restraints imposed on electronic
   commerce (e-commerce) may work in the interest of consumers or have
   anticompetitive consequences that require an antitrust intervention. The
   paper presents the basic economic concepts that apply to vertical
   restraints, and identifies the efficiency reasons and the
   anticompetitive effects that may motivate their adoption. Then, the
   relevant economic literature is surveyed in order to understand how
   e-commerce influences retail competition, taking into account its impact
   on search costs, distribution costs, and information asymmetry. The
   paper examines the legal treatment of vertical restraints on e-commerce
   in the case of selective distribution; it summarizes the position
   expressed by the European Commission in the Block Exemption Regulation
   and the accompanying guidelines, and then discusses some cases decided
   by National Competition Authorities, National Courts, and the European
   Courts. From this overview emerges the risk that the antitrust analysis
   of vertical restraints on e-commerce in selective distribution systems
   may be guided by presumptions that do not have solid economic grounds.
   The paper argues that it is unwise to adopt a formal approach for the
   legal assessment of these vertical restraints and calls for a more
   economic effect-based approach.},

   to ensure that competition within the European internal market is not

   with the European justice court, are policymaker's ensuring compliance
   with competition policy. The European market is an attractive market,
   not negligible, for any European or non-European trader, after all it is
   a market with over 500 (five hundred) million people. These days, the

Title = {The Consequences of Search Bias: How Application of the Essential
   Facilities Doctrine Remedies Google's Unrestricted Monopoly on Search in
   the United States and Europe},
Journal = {GEORGE WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {83},

Abstract = {Google's monopoly over Internet search is a serious issue. Tech policy
   experts describe the Internet as today's equivalent of electricity.
   Consumers rely on the Internet for social communication, education,
   work, entertainment, and news. Thus, as consumers deserve fair access to
   electricity, they should be able to access information available on the
   Internet. However, search engines essentially control consumers' access
   to online information, and some search engines, like Google, deny access
   to the useful information that consumers seek. This behavior is called
   search bias and is a violation of search neutrality. For example, Google
   threatened to delist Yelp unless it allowed Google to copy Yelp user
   reviews of locations on to Google Plus. Google is able to act in this
   predatory manner because it has a monopoly over Internet search. Despite
   this predatory behavior that harms consumers, the antitrust enforcement
   agencies of the United States and the European Union have failed to
   effectively intervene.
   This Note advocates that the essential facilities doctrine is a
   practical solution to the Google problem. The essential facilities
   doctrine mandates that when a monopolist holds exclusive control over a
   facility or resource, access must be shared as long as allowing access
   is practical. For example, railroad companies have been ordered to share
   access to railroad tracks, and telecommunication companies have been
   ordered to share access to cable networks. Search engines have reached
   the level of an essential facility because they provide access to the
   Internet, and Google, with its monopoly over Internet search, is
   effectively the one essential facility in control of access to the
   Internet. Google is able to easily share access with other search
   engines, but instead chooses to use predatory behavior to promote its
   own products and demote competitors' products in ways that violate
   antitrust law. Therefore, Google must be ordered, under the essential
   facilities doctrine, to share access to its resource by fairly allowing
   websites to be ranked by Google's search engine according to merit and
   not by whether they compete with Google. This will allow consumers
   access to online information and will prevent Google from harming
   competition.},

Abstract = {Purpose The paper aims to discuss the expected changes 5G will bring to
   the assessment of active mobile network sharing agreements from a
   competition policy point of view. Design/methodology/approach The paper
   distinguishes between current, early 5G networks and the fully-fledged
   5G envisioned for the future, then focuses on the main competition
   concerns where 5G may bring the most significant changes in the
   evaluation compared to 4G. Findings The authors find that while network
   sharing for early 5G can be evaluated in a similar way to previous
   generations, fully-fledged 5G can raise new issues. The authors predict
   these main concerns to be service differentiation, cost commonality
   between the parties and the parties' ability and incentives to grant
   access to critical inputs to downstream competitors. Due to the huge
   costs of 5G rollout, network sharing is set to become even more
   widespread than before. For each of the concerns, the authors show that
   they are not easy to substantiate and they may even become less serious
   than under 4G. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge,
   this paper is one of the first contributions to analyse the impact of
   fully-fledged 5G on mobile network sharing agreements' competitive
   assessment.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Bargaining regularly takes place on the business-to-business side of
   two-sided markets. However, little is known about the consequences of
   these negotiations. In this paper, we allow the platform (or a policy
   maker) to choose between a standard design (offering posted prices to
   both sides) or a design with bargaining (offering a posted price to
   consumers and negotiating with at least some firms). We find that the
   platform pursues negotiations when it has a strong bargaining position
   and does so by targeting firms with the largest network effects. While
   this behavior may appear exploitive, we show that profits and welfare
   often align across platform designs. This alignment stems from how
   bargaining incentivizes the platform: Greater platform bargaining power
   allows the platform to extract more of the network surpluses, since it
   can convert more of the firm surplus into profits, and this incentivizes
   the platform to draw in greater participation (generating greater
   welfare). These results suggest that platform and policy maker
   preferences often align in this setting. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Antitrust has played a major role in telecommunications policy,
   demonstrated most dramatically by the equal access mandate imposed
   during the breakup of AT\&T. In this Article we explore the extent to
   which antitrust can continue to serve as a source Of access mandates
   following the Supreme Court's 2004 Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law
   Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP decision. Although Trinko sharply
   criticized access remedies and antitrust courts' ability to enforce
   them, it is not yet clear whether future courts will interpret the
   opinion as barring all antitrust access claims. Even more importantly,
   the opinion contains language hinting at possible bases for
   differentiating among different types of access, in contrast to previous
   analyses, which have generally grouped all of the forms of access into a
   single category. We build upon this language to offer an analytical
   framework that captures the manner in which different components of a
   network can interact with one another as Parts of a complex system. Our
   analysis also offers a basis for classifying the different types of
   access into five categories: retail, wholesale, interconnection,
   platform, and unbundled. We then employ this framework to analyze a
   range of policy and doctrinal issues, including the current debate over
   network neutrality.},

Abstract = {This Article explores courts' ability to restrict occupational licensing
   regulations at the state and local level. In recent years, governments
   have extended licensing requirements well beyond their traditional
   boundaries. The literature criticizes these requirements as
   protectionist measures that stifle new entry, entrench inequality, and
   threaten the emerging sharing economy. The harder question, however, is
   whether these new requirements are illegal. This Article argues that
   they are, but that challengers should be using different doctrines to
   confront them. Current legal challenges depend on constitutional and
   antitrust law doctrines, both of which have doctrinal and normative
   limitations. Constitutional doctrines require a revival of Lochner to be
   effective, while antitrust law is doctrinally limited and expensive to
   enforce. Accordingly, I make the novel claim that courts should apply
   administrative law doctrines to scrutinize and strike down irrational
   licensing regulations. Administrative law principles are more likely to
   succeed and are more easily reconciled with both current doctrine and
   legislative supremacy. The Article therefore provides courts with a
   viable doctrinal toolkit to scrutinize licensing regimes without
   resorting to a local Lochner approach that is less practically effective
   and that raises concerns about courts' democratic legitimacy. Because
   administrative law doctrines provide more credible legal threats, they
   are also more likely to generate political pressure for reform.},

Abstract = {This article examines the coordination of inputs to the development and
   use of technology as a problem in the theory of property. Recent
   misunderstanding of property, in terms of both the substance of its
   rights and the implications of its remedies, have presented property as
   an obstacle tourather than as a platform forurapidly evolving
   technology. This article will first present a framework for property
   that captures its role in organizations, intellectual property, as well
   as property law itself. An information-cost theory of property stresses
   modularity, standardization, and hybrid systems of private and common
   rights, which allow for separation of functions and specialization.
   Modularity and separation in property allow for specialization but also
   give rise to the potential for strategic behavior. Each specialist may
   only maximize locally, which can lead to social losses. To counteract
   this strategic behavior, a combination of boundary placement and
   interface rules can be used, as is commonly seen in common property
   systems and their variants. The article then applies this framework to
   Standard-Setting Organizations (SSOs) and shows that separation of the
   standardization function is yet another type of property separation and
   specialization. As with other dimensions of separation, strategic
   behavior becomes possible. But contrary to some widespread views, the
   tools of property do not simply cause the problem of opportunistic
   holdup in SSOs; property also provides some solutions, in this case
   through doctrines of equity that are aimed at counteracting opportunism
   in general.},

Title = {THE GOOGLE BOOK SEARCH SETTLEMENT: A NEW ORPHAN-WORKS MONOPOLY?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {383-409},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper considers the proposed settlement agreement between Google
   and the Authors Guild relating to Google Book Search (GBS). I focus on
   three issues that raise antitrust and competition policy concerns.
   First, the agreement calls for Google to act as agent for rightsholders
   in setting the price of online access to consumers. Google is tasked
   with developing a pricing algorithm that will maximize revenues for each
   of those works. Direct competition among rightsholders would push prices
   towards some measure of costs and would not be designed to maximize
   revenues. The consumer access pricing provision might very well fail a
   challenge under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Second, and much more
   centrally to the settlement agreement, the opt-out class action will
   make it possible for Google to include orphan works in its book search
   service. Orphan works are works as to which the rightsholder cannot be
   identified or found. The opt-out class action is the vehicle for
   large-scale collective action by active rightsholders. Active
   rightsholders have little incentive to compete with themselves by
   granting multiple licenses of their works or of the orphan works. Plus
   under the terms of the settlement agreement, active rightsholders
   benefit directly from the revenues attributable to orphan works used in
   GBS. We can mitigate the market power that will otherwise arise through
   the settlement by expanding the number of rights licenses available
   under the settlement agreement. To do that, we should take the step of
   unbundling the orphan works deal from the overall settlement agreement
   and create a separate license to use those works. All of that will
   undoubtedly add more complexity to what is already a large piece of
   work, and it may make sense to push out the new licenses to the future.
   That would mean ensuring now that the court retains jurisdiction to do
   that and/or giving the new registry created in the settlement the power
   to do this sort of licensing. Third, there is a risk that approval by
   the court of the settlement could cause antitrust immunities to attach
   to the arrangements created by the settlement agreement. As it is highly
   unlikely that the fairness hearing will undertake a meaningful antitrust
   analysis of those arrangements, if the district court approves the
   settlement, the court should include a clause-call this a no Noerr
   clause-in the order approving the settlement providing that no antitrust
   immunities attach from the court's approval.},

Abstract = {The world we live in today is defined by three great arcs. The first is
   the world of semiconductors and the innovation characterized by Moore's
   law, the second is the creation of ubiquitous wireless access, and the
   third is the emergence of the internet platform. In that context, this
   Essay looks at government claims of monopolization in telecommunications
   and computing by considering past antitrust actions against AT\&T, IBM,
   and Microsoft. Early antitrust actions against AT\&T and IBM of course
   long predated the rise of the Chicago School, but later actions against
   AT\&T and IBM overlapped that rise as did the antitrust actions against
   Microsoft. These antitrust actions intersected with and influenced these
   three arcs, though teasing out the precise nature of that influence is
   ultimately quite tricky.},

Abstract = {This article describes process of modernization of the bilateral FTA
   concluded between New Zealand and China in 2008. New Zealand and the PRC
   are dynamic market economies that depend on the development of
   international trade of goods, services and investments to enhance
   economic growth. Strong connections in the world economy and easy access
   to markets are the basis of their political contacts. The positive
   impact of the 2008 agreement contributed to the intensive development of
   mutual trade and investment sector.
   The specifics of the modernization of the FTA between New Zealand and
   China are considered. It was noted that the governments of the states
   have chosen nine areas for regulation within the framework of the
   updated agreement. Four new areas of regulation are analyzed -
   competition policy, electronic commerce, government procurement,
   environment and trade.
   It is concluded that the modernization of the FTA between New Zealand
   and China reflects changes in the structure of economic cooperation
   between the countries. The role of negotiations as an additional channel
   for dialogue and political cooperation of New Zealand as a ``small
   country{''} with such an economic giant as China is significant. For
   China, the modernization of the FTA is a continuation of the long-term
   cooperation scheme with the small developed state of the West. Using the
   positive achievements made in relations with New Zealand, the Chinese
   leadership is trying to create a stable platform for expanding the base
   of such agreements with other Western states.},

Abstract = {An irony of the information age is that the companies responsible for
   the most extensive surveillance of individuals in history large
   platforms such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google have themselves remained
   unusually shielded from being monitored by government regulators. But
   the legal literature on state information acquisition is dominated by
   the privacy problems of excess collection from individuals, not
   businesses. There has been little sustained attention to the problem of
   insufficient information collection from businesses. This Article
   articulates the administrative state's normative framework for
   monitoring businesses and shows how that framework is increasingly in
   tension with privacy concerns. One emerging complication is the
   perception that the state, through agencies such as the National
   Security Administration, deploys large technology companies to surveil
   individuals. As a result, any routine regulatory monitoring of platforms
   even for the purpose of prosecuting those platforms would implicate an
   overbearing state peering into our personal lives. Moreover, opponents
   of regulation have weaponized privacy arguments to shield other
   businesses from monitoring, such as banks. A sharper understanding of
   the institutional, legal, and informational differences between
   regulatory monitoring and personal surveillance is needed. Juxtaposing
   these two state tools reveals that the tension between regulation and
   privacy is largely illusory. Regulators today most notably the Federal
   Trade Commission have untapped power to monitor emerging risks in big
   technology and other sectors. They should not hesitate to use that power
   to pursue a more informed and collaborative path to achieving their
   missions.},

   reorganized in the after financial crisis 2007-2009 years period. The
   financial systems development faced new macroeconomic environment. The
   financial conglomerates are actively competing on the financial markets
   in now day situation. The financial institutes' competitiveness is
   determined more and more by the factor of financial innovations on the
   information technology base. And the competition is escalating. This is
   the result of the IT companies, eCommerce firm's invasion in the
   financial area. They are using the marketplace, information platform,
   the Big Data technologies. The major world commercial banks answer is
   the business-model change. The banking sector, the financial companies,
   in their turn, are targeting to expend their personal client service
   orientation with the Fintech ecosystems instruments. The banks became
   the management centers of the financial conglomerates and banking
   groups. Their role today is realizing the asset control over the SPV,
   investment funds, pension funds, insurance companies, which are
   transformed into the financial conglomerate's divisions. The financial
   sphere space extends and so far, the prudential regulation and
   authorities' activity spreads to all financial business aspects. This
   government activity is targeting today also on the international
   multipole competition. For example, the USA technological and financial
   innovations on the global financial markets are combined with the
   multilateral and unilateral economic sanctions aimed at banning the
   Chinese economic and political expansion.},

Title = {RETHINKING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE COMMON LAW},
Journal = {NOTRE DAME LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},

Pages = {795-836},
Abstract = {This Article shows how Posner and other scholars who claimed that common
   law was efficient misunderstood the structure of common law. If common
   law was more efficient, there would have been a noticeable push across
   most, if not all, doctrines to greater efficiency. This has not been the
   case. Rather, common law, better recast as a ``platform,{''} could,
   under a certain set of parameters, lead to efficient outcomes. Next, the
   Article's analysis suggests that while not every judge thinks about
   efficiency in decisionmaking there must be some architectural or
   governance feature pushing in the direction of efficiency-which exists
   in some areas of law and not in others. This Article explains two-sided
   markets, or platforms, generally and applies the modular open-source
   platform model to judge made law. In doing so, it explores concepts that
   impact the efficiency of such platforms-platform governance, modularity,
   and fragmentation. Then, this Article applies the understanding of
   platforms to several areas of law that might be understood as more prone
   to economic analysis because the issues addressed in law tend to be more
   ``economic,{''} such as torts, bankruptcy, patents, and corporations. In
   these areas, no combination of platform architecture and modularity has
   allowed for the development of more efficient legal rules as a general
   matter. Finally, this Article studies antitrust law as the one area of
   law that suggests that the efficiency of common law is possible and the
   causal mechanism of necessary conditions that needs to be met. Antitrust
   law is different than other areas of law because of a singular goal, an
   architectural governance based on a single federal court (the Supreme
   Court) with few substantive legislative changes for the past one hundred
   years, which provides for coherent governance of the platform. This
   Article concludes by discussing the implications of an efficient
   platform design for other areas of law.},

Abstract = {This paper constructs a Walrasian equilibrium model based on impersonal
   networking decision to explore one of the typical phenomenon in
   eCommerce market, Bundling Pricing. It departures from the other models
   of bundling and tying by allowing substitution between goods, flexible
   quantities of goods, re-sale of any goods, competitive market, and
   ex-ante identical utility function for all individuals. It shows that
   the function of bundling sale in a competitive market is to get
   intangible information goods involved in the division of labor and
   commercialised production, meanwhile avoiding direct pricing of such
   goods, thereby promoting division of labor and aggregate productivity.
   According to this theory of bundling, bundling in a competitive market
   is Pareto efficient and it plays a very important role to utilize
   positive network effects of division of labor on aggregate productivity.
   Antitrust prosecution should pay more attention to the intention of
   blocking free entry rather than bundling itself.},

Title = {Do product market reforms raise innovation? Evidence from Micro-data
   across 12 countries},

Abstract = {How does policy affect innovation and the digital economy? We revisit
   how product market regulation affects innovation and develop a novel
   framework for thinking about digital regulation. Using new company-level
   microdata across 12 countries between 1998 and 2012, this paper first
   estimates the effect of competition policy on innovation. We find that a
   standard deviation rise in standardized index of product market
   regulation is associated with a 1.03\% decline in innovation activities.
   These declines are a result of product market regulation on the
   incentives to invest in in-house R\&D and make the appropriate capital
   acquisitions, as well as of the effects of regulation on the cost of
   innovation activities. We then theorize on the effect of digital
   regulation on innovation and we empirically explore it on a sub-sample
   of the years in our analysis. We find that ``protective regulation{''},
   i.e., regulation that creates predictability and scope for markets to
   work, confers a positive effect on innovation, while ``restrictive
   regulation{''}, i.e., regulation that endeavors to spell out negative
   behaviors, confers a negative effect on innovation. We also find that
   the digital regulation results are more sensitive to the content of
   regulation. We attribute this ambiguity to the fact that markers require
   an enhanced level of trust to be operative.},

Abstract = {The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expands health insurance coverage to
   millions of Americans. Despite the act having been signed into law more
   than five years ago, health care affordability in the ACA era remains a
   topic of empirical inquiry, relevant to academicians and public policy
   makers. A primary concern, with implications for any future legislation,
   is whether all consumer groups have equitable access to health insurance
   options through ACA-mandated health insurance markets (HIMs). Utilizing
   pricing information and demographic data for states that adopted the
   Healthcare. gov platform, this study examines relationships between
   health insurance premiums, competition, and population characteristics.
   Results indicate that competition within HIMs is multifaceted. Although
   markets with a large number of insurance plans are associated with lower
   premiums, this effect is moderated by the concentration of insurers in
   the market and number of rating areas. Furthermore, population
   characteristics are related to premiums, where premiums vary by HIM
   demographics. Findings also suggest that access is less equitable in
   areas that have not adopted Medicaid expansion plans and areas that
   serve a large percentage of uninsured consumers.},

Abstract = {In this article for the 40th Anniversary of the Journal of Public Policy
   \& Marketing (JPPM), the authors first share what is meant by
   ``policy,{''} ``public policy,{''} and ``marketing and public policy{''}
   for researchers in our field. The authors then offer examples of JPPM
   research informing policy across different stages of the policy-making
   process: problem identification, agenda setting, policy formulation,
   budgeting, implementation, and evaluation. They also discuss important
   sources of public policy (e.g., federal, state, and international
   agencies; self-regulation; the courts; nonprofits; society; industry
   standards; company policies; personal ethics) and their role in the
   marketing and public policy process. The authors then offer JPPM
   application examples (consumer protection; antitrust/competition;
   vulnerability; diversity, equity, and inclusion; nutrition labeling;
   addiction, cannabis, and antidrug research; tobacco warning labeling and
   education; and privacy and technology) and share ideas for developing
   research that contributes to the marketing and public policy discipline
   and in making a positive difference in society and people's lives.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the creation and use of unique identifiers for
   intellectual property. General concepts applicable to unique identifiers
   are defined and discussed {[}identifier, digital object, dumb and
   intelligent identifiers, readability, affordance or computability,
   multiple identification, resolution, metadata, persistence, granularity,
   derivatives (e.g., versions, formats, manifestations, and copies), check
   digits, and intermediate objects]. Requirements for unique identifiers
   are reviewed Capacity issues for an identifier scheme and business issue
   (cost, antitrust considerations, and intellectual property rights) are
   explored, Technical and administrative issues of identifiers are
   discussed, with particular reference to the uses of identifiers, which
   necessitates intelligence within a system of unique identifiers, (scope,
   protocol independence, multiple roles, fungibility, persistence,
   standards, and emerging structural metadata approaches). Two brief
   illustrations of failure in unique identifiers are given. The role of
   unique identifiers on the Internet is discussed with explanation of the
   architecture of uniform resource addressing, specifying the resource
   from a uniform resource name (URN), names and addresses, URN
   implementations, and a future e digital object infrastructure. Brief
   examples of unique information identifier systems in music, text, and
   digital objects in general ar e discussed. Recommendations are made for
   actions to assist in the development of future identifiers.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW \& ECONOMICS},
Abstract = {The digital economy has brought new business models that rely on
   zero-price markets and multi-sided platforms nested in business
   ecosystems. The traditional concept of market power used by competition
   authorities cannot engage with this new reality in which (economic)
   power manifests beyond price and output within a relevant market. These
   developments have culminated in multiple recent calls for a more
   multidimensional concept of power. Consequently, suggestions over new
   concepts of power triggering antitrust/regulatory intervention, such as
   `strategic market status', `conglomerate market power', `intermediation
   power', `structuring digital platforms', or `gatekeepers' have
   proliferated to complete, or even substitute, the archetypical concept
   of market or monopoly power in competition law. However, a theoretical
   framework for this multidimensional concept of power that can set the
   basis for new metrics is missing. This article makes three contributions
   in that direction. First, we conceptualize different forms of (economic)
   power that go beyond competition within a single relevant market in
   terms of competition law and economics. Second, we propose new metrics
   to measure two forms of power: panopticon power and power based on
   differential dependency between value co-creators. Third, we test the
   latter and show how they could reduce false positives and false
   negatives when assessing dominance.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect of tied-in sales by an essential goods
   monopolist in a two-sided market. In a two-sided market, the essential
   goods monopolist may tie a good essential for users, such as an
   operating system, with a platform, such as a media player, in the user
   side of the market, to extract profits not from the user side, but from
   the developer side of the market. From this simple idea, we build a
   simple two-sided market model and show how the essential goods
   monopolist may tie a platform with the essential goods on the user side
   of the market to foreclose a rival firm from the developer side of the
   market. We also analyze various welfare impacts of tying and discuss the
   antitrust implications.},

Abstract = {Search engines face an interesting tradeoff in choosing the way to
   display their results. While providing high quality unpaid, or ``left
   side{''} results attracts users, doing so can also cannibalize the
   revenue that comes from paid ads on the ``right side{''}. This paper
   examines this tradeoff, focusing, in particular, on the role of users'
   post-search interaction with the websites whose links are displayed. In
   the model, high quality left side results boost demand from users,
   causing them to tolerate a search engine on which advertisers do not
   offer the lowest possible prices for the goods that they sell. However,
   because websites appearing on the left side still have an incentive to
   compete in the same market as advertisers, an increase in quality on the
   left side may reduce advertisers equilibrium prices. I analyze the
   circumstances under which this will occur and discuss the model's
   potential implications for antitrust policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The extent to which pricing executives consider consumer perceptions of
   deception, fairness, and social justice is positioned within an emerging
   area of research that triangulates the dynamic between legal
   constraints, ethical considerations, and algorithmic models to make
   pricing decisions. This paper builds a conceptual model from an analysis
   of literature describing how companies couple organizational and
   technology factors into the price-setting process. The legal frameworks
   of antitrust, data privacy, and antidiscrimination are tethered to the
   ethical frameworks of deception, fairness, and social justice to form a
   foundation of relevant organizational factors. A qualitative study is
   proposed to test the validity of the conceptual model. The primary
   contribution of this paper is to catalyze practitioner discussion and
   spur empirical research into the implications of personalized pricing
   using algorithmic models.},

   INSURANCE COMPARISON WEBSITES},
Journal = {MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Number = {3},
Pages = {324-332},
Abstract = {In the insurance market, the use of digital technologies facilitating
   online transactions is increasing together with the diffusion of the so
   called comparison websites. Taking into account this fact, the first
   issue addressed by this article is the analysis of the process of
   digitalization of the distributional channels both in life and non-life
   sectors in the European countries. Given the use of different channels,
   such as brokers, agents and bancassurance, a particular role is played
   by the comparison website. The second issue is to look at the regulatory
   interventions at the European level. These interventions mainly promote
   the adoption of behaviours that ensure the correctness of the comparison
   and the transparency of the information made available to the public
   through online platform. In this direction, the author investigates
   particularly the Italian case and the intervention of the insurance
   supervisory Authority and of the national Antitrust Authority. Moreover,
   the article contribution to the literature is to examine the effects of
   the comparison website on market competition: the effects are described,
   on one hand, as positive in terms of decreasing asymmetric information
   suffered by the insured, on the other hand, as negative in terms of
   increasing the possibility of collusive behaviours by the insurance
   companies. To confirm this last point a decision by the Lithuanian
   Antitrust Authority, confirmed by the European Court of Justice, is
   quoted to show how an online platform can be an information exchange
   tool and its behaviour can be considered as a facilitating practice to
   support collusion. The purpose of the analysis proposed is to provide
   useful elements for the future regulatory interventions that will follow
   the diffusion of new distributional channels in the insurance market.
   Particularly, the growing diffusion of comparison websites will involve
   the adoption of regulatory instruments aimed not only at protecting
   consumers but also at limiting their use as tools for collusive
   behaviour.},

Abstract = {This paper focusses on the interaction between technology, the business
   environ-ment, regulation, and society in ICT industries. The role of
   technological advances in com-munication (e.g., cellular mobile, 5 G,
   spectrum allocation) and in computational advances (e.g., cloud,
   Internet of Things, artificial intelligence) along with developments in
   the busi-ness environment (e.g., disruption, convergence, Industry 4.0)
   and the regulatory environ-ment (e.g., competition law and market
   regulation) in the model is explained. The economics of network
   industries and competition law and strategies such as vertical
   inte-gration, bundling, and tying are described. The role of regulation
   and innovation is dis-cussed along with some cases.(c) 2022 Published by

Abstract = {Major League Baseball is in the process of collectivizing data used in
   sports betting. This could be exempt from antitrust scrutiny if the
   conduct falls within the business of baseball. Such an exemption raises
   the question of whether collecting official league data is sufficiently
   attenuated from the business of baseball to be subject to antitrust law,
   and if so, whether MLB violates the Sherman Act by excluding competitors
   from the league data market. This Comment makes a two-fold argument.
   First, it argues that the business of baseball should be constrained to
   cover activities directly linked to putting on baseball games. Second,
   this Comment argues that the collectivization of official league data
   for sports betting is not within the business of baseball, and that MLB
   is potentially violating the Sherman Act for excluding competitors
   through anticompetitive means. The unique business of baseball exemption
   has existed for almost one hundred years without limit, but that does
   not mean professional baseball can restrain trade in every industry it
   deals.},

Abstract = {Opening-up is the current development trend of the Internet industry,
   the major Internet companies developed jointly earnings through
   providing source codes for the third party. At the same time, the
   ``patent thicket{''} takes shape because of the special market
   competition structure and business model in the Internet opening-up
   field. Therefore, we have to Shorten the patent protection period,
   modify the Patent Law and other relevant laws, so as to improve patent
   creativity height; and explore appropriate antitrust laws to regulate
   the abuse of patent law for promoting the technology innovation of the
   Internet opening-up field.},

Title = {Learning to Collude in a Pricing Duopoly},
Journal = {M\&SOM-MANUFACTURING \& SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Abstract = {Problem definition: This paper addresses the question whether or not
   self-learning algorithms can learn to collude instead of compete against
   each other, without violating existing competition law.
   Academiclpractical relevance: This question is practically relevant (and
   hotly debated) for competition regulators, and academically relevant in
   the area of analysis of multi-agent data-driven algorithms. Methodology:
   We construct a price algorithm based on simultaneous-perturbation
   Kiefer-Wolfowitz recursions. We derive theoretical bounds on its
   limiting behavior of prices and revenues, in the case that both sellers
   in a duopoly independently use the algorithm, and in the case that one
   seller uses the algorithm and the other seller sets prices
   competitively. Results: We mathematically prove that, if implemented
   independently by two price-setting firms in a duopoly, prices will
   converge to those that maximize the firms' joint revenue in cage this is
   profitable for both firms, and to a competitive equilibrium otherwise.
   We prove this latter convergence result under the assumption that the
   firms use a misspecified monopolist demand model, thereby providing
   evidence for the so-called market-response hypothesis that both firms'
   pricing as a monopolist may result in convergence to a competitive
   equilibrium. If the competitor is not willing to collaborate but prices
   according to a strategy from a certain class of strategies, we prove
   that the prices generated by our algorithm converge to a best-response
   to the competitor's limit price. Managerial implications: Our algorithm
   can learn to collude under self-play while simultaneously learn to price
   competitively against a `regular' competitor, in a setting where the
   price-demand relation is unknown and within the boundaries of
   competition law. This demonstrates that algorithmic collusion is a
   genuine threat in realistic market scenarios. Moreover, our work
   exemplifies how algorithms can be explicitly designed to learn to
   collude, and demonstrates that algorithmic collusion is facilitated (a)
   by the empirically observed practice of (explicitly or implicitly)
   sharing demand information, and (b) by allowing different firms in a
   market to use the same price algorithm. These are important and concrete
   insights for lawmakers and competition policy professionals struggling
   with how to respond to algorithmic collusion.},

Abstract = {Motivated by recent antitrust cases in markets with zero-pricing, we
   develop a leverage theory of tying in two-sided markets. In the presence
   of the nonnegative price constraint, the Chicago school critique of
   tie-ins fails to hold. In the independent products case, tying provides
   a mechanism to circumvent the constraint in the tied market without
   inviting aggressive responses by the rival firm. In the complementary
   products case, the ``price squeeze{''} mechanism cannot be used to
   extract surplus from the more efficient rival firm without tying. We
   identify conditions under which tying in two-sided markets is profitable
   and explore its welfare implications.},

Abstract = {The success of late entrants in many digital markets suggests network
   and lock-in effects, albeit important market forces in most digital
   markets, do not confer sustainable first mover advantages. In our
   analysis we suggest exclusionary practices may play a major role
   explaining the rise of ``winner-takes-it-all{''} markets on the
   Internet. The entry deterrence literature has extensively analyzed
   incumbents' strategic moves in order to make market entry unprofitable
   or, at least, to minimize the harm that entry causes. In our paper we
   propose a richer theoretical framework allowing both the incumbent as
   well as a new entrant to carry out strategic investments. Those allow
   the incumbent to deter market entry, but also the new entrant to squeeze
   the incumbent out of the market. We find that competitive advantage and
   strategic interaction determine a ``winner-takes-it all{''} or a duopoly
   market outcome. If neither player enjoys a clear-cut cost or demand
   advantage, a duopoly market outcome will emerge. However, for both
   incumbent and new entrant there is a strong incentive to complement a
   possible competitive advantage with exclusionary practices in order to
   monopolize a market and increase profits. This result suggests
   ``winner-takes-it-all{''} market results on the Internet may result from
   exclusionary practices, nourishing antitrust concerns with today's major
   Internet players' market dominance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Minimum Efficient Scale, Competition on the Merits, and The Special
   Responsibility of a Dominant Undertaking},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW \& ECONOMICS},
Abstract = {As a leading model of law on abuse of dominance, Article 102 TFEU hosts
   two notoriously vague concepts: competition on the merits and the
   special responsibility of a dominant undertaking. The former could
   mislead abuse assessments into an illusion of inherent impropriety,
   while the latter is susceptible to expansive interpretations that
   undermine the pivotal role of dominance. We propose a test centred on
   the concept of minimum efficient scale, which has been seriously
   overlooked or even mischaracterized under Article 102, to complement the
   as-efficient-competitor rationale. This test clarifies-with respect to
   exclusionary conduct-competition on the merits in a purely
   efficiency-based way and gives content to the special responsibility
   concept. It is compatible with the case law and can be operationalized
   vis-a-vis digital platform markets to tackle practices such as
   self-preferencing. It shows potential in enhancing the robustness of ex
   post antitrust when ex ante regulation has become the more popular
   recourse.},

Title = {CURE-Towards enforcing a reliable timeline for cloud forensics: Model,
   architecture, and experiments},

Abstract = {A malicious alteration of system-provided timeline can negatively affect
   the reliability of computer forensics. Indeed, detecting such changes
   and possibly reconstructing the correct timeline of events is of
   paramount importance for court admissibility and logical coherence of
   collected evidence. However, reconstructing the correct timeline for a
   set of network nodes can be difficult since an adversary has a wealth of
   opportunities to disrupt the timeline and to generate a fake one. This
   aspect is exacerbated in cloud computing, where host and guest
   machine-time can be manipulated in various ways by an adversary.
   Therefore, it is important to guarantee the integrity of the timeline of
   events for cloud host and guest nodes, or at least to ensure that
   timeline alterations do not go undetected. This paper provides several
   contributions. First, we survey the issues related to cloud machine-time
   reliability. Then, we introduce a novel architecture (CURE) aimed at
   providing timeline resilience to cloud nodes. Further, we implement the
   proposed framework and extensively test it on both a simulated
   environment and on a real cloud. We evaluate and discuss collected
   results showing the effectiveness of our proposal. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {We analyze the ability of firms to sustain collusion in a setting in
   which horizontally differentiated firms can price discriminate based on
   private information. Firms receive private, noisy signals regarding
   customers' preferences. We find that there is a non-monotonic
   relationship between signal quality and the sustainability of collusion.
   Starting from a low level, an increase in signal precision first
   facilitates collusion. There is, however, a threshold beyond which any
   further increase renders collusion less sustainable. Our analysis
   provides important insights for competition policy, particularly in
   light of firms' growing reliance on increasingly sophisticated computer
   algorithms to analyze consumer data and to make pricing decisions. In
   contrast to previous findings, our results reveal that a ban on price
   discrimination can help to prevent collusive behavior as long as signals
   are sufficiently noisy.},

Title = {The Google search case in Europe: tying and the single monopoly profit
   theorem in two-sided markets},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This paper provides an economic and legal theory of harm applicable to
   the case against Google in Europe over search bias. So far, no clear
   legal and economic theory has yet been delineated by the European
   Commission, nor consensus in the literature has emerged with regard to
   the theory of foreclosure that could support the case, or with regard to
   the specific form of abuse of dominance applicable under European law.
   The paper shows that the law and economics of tying applies to search
   bias. From a legal standpoint, it is not necessary to rely on the more
   formalistic elements of Article 102 TFEU, or to characterize Google as
   an essential facility, in order to find a valid legal theory of harm. We
   show that Google's conduct of linking its proprietary vertical (or
   specialized) search platforms to its horizontal (or general) search
   platform through visual prominence, as it has done with Google Shopping,
   fits within the legal boundaries of tying under European law. From an
   economic perspective, we show that the two-sided nature of both
   horizontal and vertical search provides compelling reasons why
   foreclosure of competition may be profitable, and why the single
   monopoly profit theorem may fail in this context. As we show in the
   paper, by tying vertical search to general search through visual
   prominence, Google can attract additional advertisers on its vertical
   search platform that would have possibly advertised on competing
   vertical search platforms without a tie. The effect of tying is a
   restriction on competition in vertical search that deserves antitrust
   scrutiny.},

Title = {THE MAP OF COMMERCE: INTERNET SEARCH, COMPETITION, AND THE CIRCULAR FLOW

Abstract = {Search firms provide matchmaking services between consumers and
   suppliers that are central to the efficiency of the economy. The
   significant economic contributions of search firms as commercial
   intermediaries have important implications for antitrust policy towards
   search markets. As search firms generate more information about buyers
   and sellers, they become intermediaries for an increasing proportion of
   economic transactions. This article introduces the concept of the ``map
   of commerce{''} to describe the extensive directory of business
   constructed by search firms. This article also introduces the concept of
   the ``circular flow of information{''} to represent the comprehensive
   nature of the economic information managed by search firms. These firms
   induce information revelation through self-selection both by consumers
   and by advertisers. Consumers reveal personal information through the
   use of keywords and through their online behavior. Advertisers reveal
   company information by bidding on positions on the search page. Search
   firms employ information to match buyers with sellers more effectively
   and to increase earnings from advertising. The analysis shows that
   economic efficiencies generated by the circular flow of information
   depend on the strength of competition among search firms. The discussion
   considers antitrust policy towards Internet search markets, including
   issues of privacy, competition, and cooperative agreements.},

Abstract = {Graphics processing units (GPUs) are increasingly common on desktops,
   servers, and embedded platforms. In this article, we report on new
   security issues related to CUDA, which is the most widespread platform
   for GPU computing. In particular, details and proofs-of-concept are
   provided about novel vulnerabilities to which CUDA architectures are
   subject. We show how such vulnerabilities can be exploited to cause
   severe information leakage. As a case study, we experimentally show how
   to exploit one of these vulnerabilities on a GPU implementation of the
   AES encryption algorithm. Finally, we also suggest software patches and
   alternative approaches to tackle the presented vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {Despite its long history in antitrust policy, predation remains a poorly
   understood phenomenon. The main difficulty is in empirically identifying
   predatory intent. I propose a method for measuring the effect of
   reputation, whose significance would enable us to infer predatory
   intents. Maximum likelihood estimation using simulated annealing
   algorithm is conducted with a sample of US airline markets. The results
   provide some support for the presence of entrants learning and
   reputation effect. As an application, I discuss how the outcomes of my
   empirical model could help analyze such antitrust cases as the American
   Airlines Case. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Retail most favored nation ({''}RMFN{''}) clauses are commonly found in
   vertical agreements inked between downstream e-commerce platform
   providers and upstream suppliers. Competition authorities in Europe have
   investigated RMFN clauses in e-commerce markets on grounds that they can
   foreclose competitors from the market, lead to collusion or soften
   competition amongst competitors. We present an assessment of RMFN
   clauses under Singapore's competition law framework. We find that
   Singapore's competition law can adequately deal with collusion and
   foreclosure concerns. However, the vertical agreement exemption in
   Singapore's competition law may prevent the Competition Commission of
   Singapore ({''}CCS{''}) from sanctioning RMFN clauses that soften
   competition. We conclude from our game theoretic models that the
   softening of competition Theory of Harm ({''}TOH{''}) is unlikely to
   materialize. Our findings also contribute more generally to competition
   authorities' enforcement priorities and tools involving RMFN clauses and
   the softening of competition TOH.},

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Bitcoin provides its users with transaction-processing services which
   are similar to those of traditional payment systems. This article models
   the novel economic structure implied by Bitcoin's innovative
   decentralized design, which allows the payment system to be reliably
   operated by unrelated parties called miners. We find that this
   decentralized design protects users from monopoly pricing. Competition
   among service providers within the platform and free entry imply no
   entity can profitably affect the level of fees paid by users. Instead, a
   market for transaction-processing determines the fees users pay to gain
   priority and avoid transaction-processing delays. The article (i)
   derives closed-form formulas of the fees and waiting times and studies
   their properties, (ii) compares pricing under the Bitcoin Payment System
   to that under a traditional payment system operated by a
   profit-maximizing firm, and (iii) suggests protocol design modifications
   to enhance the platform's efficiency. The Appendix describes and
   explains the main attributes of Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain
   technology.},

Abstract = {We discuss three important projects that economists at the Competition
   and Markets Authority have completed over the past year. First, our work
   on the Funerals Market Investigation provides an illustration of how
   demand-side problems can lead to a lack of competition, as well as
   demonstrating the CMA's willingness to consider price control and
   regulatory remedies where necessary. Second, on the Sabre/Farelogix
   merger case, we point to how our assessment dealt with uncertainty in
   innovative markets, the importance of preventing incumbents from
   acquiring start-ups, and the risks of following formalistic market
   definitions, especially in multi-sided platform sectors. Third, we set
   out the most notable developments in our revised Mergers Assessment
   Guidelines-including the assessment of future competition even when
   subject to significant uncertainty-and the assessment of the loss of
   dynamic competition and its effect on innovation incentives.},

Abstract = {We discuss three interesting cases that the Competition and Markets
   Authority (CMA) has dealt with over the past year. First, we cover the
   ICE/Trayport vertical merger, which was prohibited by the CMA. Second,
   we discuss the CMA's recent market investigation into the UK energy
   sector. The CMA arrived at the unexpected finding that markets with
   homogeneous products, multiple players and low entry barriers can still
   lead to significant competition concerns. Finally, we discuss the CMA's
   work in relation to retail most favoured nation clauses, and include
   econometric results showing the impact of these clauses on platforms'
   commission fees .},

Abstract = {In recent years, with the rapid development of the Internet, a number of
   Internet companies appeared, resulting in a new competition mode among
   internet companies, so the model of analyzing the competition mode among
   traditional enterprise can not be appropriate for new competition mode
   under internet environment. To solve this problem, according to the
   model of analyzing internet companies competition model from national
   and foreign, such as 3Q war, combing with zero price strategy between
   Tencent and 360 Company. 3Q competition model was established, two
   assumptions of imitation and independent innovation was proposed basing
   on 360 company model, the transformed model was deduced, these
   assumptions have been tested finding the advantages of independent
   innovation and the deduction of results was gained, in order to develop
   competition policy for national internet companies which provide
   suggestions for suppressing effectively competition among Internet
   companies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {607-626},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of tying on market competition and
   social welfare in two-sided markets when economic agents can engage in
   multi-homing by participating in multiple platforms to reap maximal
   network benefits. The model shows that tying induces more consumers to
   multi-home and makes platform-specific exclusive content available to
   more consumers, which is beneficial to content providers. As a result,
   tying can be welfare-enhancing if multi-homing is allowed, even in cases
   where its welfare impacts are negative in the absence of multi-homing.
   The analysis thus can have important implications for recent antitrust
   cases in industries where multi-homing is prevalent.},

Abstract = {In traditional markets, firms can charge prices that are significantly
   elevated relative to their costs only if there is a market failure.
   However, this is not true in a two-sided market (like Amazon, Uber, and
   Mastercard), in which firms often subsidize one side of the market and
   generate revenue from the other. This means consideration of one side of
   the market in isolation is problematic. The Court embraced this view in
   Ohio v American Express, requiring that anticompetitive harm on one side
   of a two-sided market be weighed against benefits on the other side.
   Legal scholars denounce this decision, which, practically, will make it
   much more difficult to wield antitrust as a tool to rein in two-sided
   markets. This inability is concerning as two-sided markets are growing
   in importance. Furthermore, the pricing structures used by platforms can
   be regressive, with those least well-off subsidizing their affluent and
   financially sophisticated counterparts.
   In this Essay, I argue that consumer protection, rather than antitrust,
   is best suited to tame two-sided markets. Consumer protection authority
   allows for intervention on the grounds that platform users create
   unavoidable externalities for all consumers. The Consumer Financial
   Protection Bureau (CFPB) has broad power to curtail ``unfair, abusive,
   and deceptive practices.{''} This authority can be used to restrict
   practices that decrease consumer welfare, like the antisteering rules at
   issue in Ohio v American Express.},

Abstract = {The Internet continues to transform the information industries and
   challenge intellectual property law to develop a competition policy
   strategy to regulate networked products. In particular, inventors of
   ``information platforms{''} that support the viewing of content-be they
   instant messaging systems, media players, or Web browsers face a muddled
   set of legal doctrines that govern the scope of available intellectual
   property protection. This uncertainty reflects a fundamental debate
   about what conditions will best facilitate innovation in the information
   industries-a debate most often played out at the conceptual extremes
   between the ``commons{''} and ``proprietary control{''} approaches to
   the Internet and intellectual property policy.
   This Article proposes a ``competitive platforms model{''} as a new
   conceptual framework to govern intellectual property and Internet
   policy. This model suggests that where information platforms will
   continue to face competitive alternatives, intellectual property law and
   policy should encourage competition among them as a means of driving
   companies to develop superior products and enabling them to appropriate
   rewards from their inventions. Alternatively, where a particular
   information platform emerges as the dominant one for example, in the
   case of Microsoft Windows in the market for PC operating
   systems-intellectual property protection against the reverse engineering
   of its platform standard or user interface should recede. As a strategy
   to implement the competitive platforms model, this Article proposes a
   reformulation of the fair use and misuse principles-as developed in both
   copyright and patent law-to provide a unified, clear, and coherent
   framework for protecting platform standards and user interfaces.
   Moreover, the competitive platforms model calls upon industry
   standard-setting bodies and the federal government to reassume the
   critical coordination and funding roles they served in the early days of
   the Internet in order to support the development of the parts of the
   Internet's information infrastructure that are intrinsically open to all
   and thus are vulnerable to underinvestment.},

Abstract = {Since the seminal papers by Rochet and Tirole, the payment card industry
   has represented an elected field of study for the economic features of
   multisided markets and their effects on both regulation and antitrust
   analysis. The recent judgements of the UK High Court of Justice in
   MasterCard and of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in
   American Express are particularly relevant because they are the first to
   concretely apply the economic theory of multisided markets to the
   payment card industry. In particular, given the nature of multisided
   markets, the coexistence of different business models, and the dualistic
   competitive interpretation of the conduct, courts have emphasised the
   need to articulate a judgement around counterfactual hypotheses. This is
   a way to measure the actual impact on competition, testing the realistic
   scenario that would occur if the investigated conduct was absent, so as
   to give appropriate consideration to the business model of the single
   platform. The same reasoning that makes us consider advantageous a
   flexible antitrust approach forces us to be critical of the current US
   and EU regulation of payment systems.},

Title = {INTERNET SAFE HARBORS AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF COPYRIGHT LAW},
Journal = {NOTRE DAME LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {93},
Number = {2},
Pages = {499-564},
Abstract = {This Article explores the potential displacement of substantive
   copyright law in the increasingly important online environment. In 1998,
   Congress enacted a system of intermediary safe harbors as part of the
   Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The internet safe harbors and
   the associated system of notice-and-takedown fundamentally changed the
   incentives of platforms, users, and rightsholders in relation to claims
   of copyright infringement. These different incentives interact to yield
   a functional balance of copyright online that diverges markedly from the
   experience of copyright law in traditional media environments. More
   recently, private agreements between rightsholders and large commercial
   internet platforms have been made in the shadow of those safe harbors.
   These ``DMCA-plus{''} agreements relate to automatic copyright filtering
   systems, such as YouTube's Content ID, that not only return platforms to
   their gatekeeping role, but encode that role in algorithms and software.
   The normative implications of these developments are contestable. Fair
   use and other axioms of copyright law still nominally apply online, but
   in practice, the safe harbors and private agreements made in the shadow
   of those safe harbors are now far more important determinants of online
   behavior than whether that conduct is, or is not, substantively in
   compliance with copyright law. Substantive copyright law is not
   necessarily irrelevant online, but its relevance is indirect and
   contingent. The attenuated relevance of substantive copyright law to
   online expression has benefits and costs that appear fundamentally
   incommensurable. Compared to the offline world, online platforms are
   typically more permissive of infringement, and more open to new and
   unexpected speech and new forms of cultural participation. However,
   speech on these platforms is also more vulnerable to overreaching claims
   by rightsholders. There is no easy metric for comparing the value of
   noninfringing expression enabled by the safe harbors to that which has
   been unjustifiably suppressed by misuse of the notice-and-takedown
   system. Likewise, the harm that copyright infringement does to
   rightsholders is not easy to calculate, nor is it easy to weigh against
   the many benefits of the safe harbors.
   DMCA-plus agreements raise additional incommensurable potential costs
   and benefits. Automatic copyright enforcement systems have obvious
   advantages for both platforms and rightsholders: they may reduce the
   harm of copyright infringement; they may also allow platforms to be more
   hospitable to certain types of user content. However, automated
   enforcement systems may also place an undue burden on fair use and other
   forms of noninfringing speech. The design of copyright enforcement
   robots encodes a series of policy choices made by platforms and
   rightsholders and, as a result, subjects online speech and cultural
   participation to a new layer of private ordering and control. In the
   future, private interests, not public policy, will determine the
   conditions under which users get to participate in online platforms that
   adopt these systems. In a world where communication and expression is
   policed by copyright robots, the substantive content of copyright law
   matters only to the extent that those with power decide that it should
   matter.},

Abstract = {We analyze exclusionary conduct of platforms in 2-sided markets.
   Motivated by recent antitrust cases, we provide a discussion of the
   likely positive and normative effects of exclusivity clauses, which
   prevent tenants from opening outlets in other shopping centers covered
   by the clause. In a standard 2-sided market model, we show that
   exclusivity agreements are especially profitable for the incumbent and
   detrimental to social welfare if competition is intense between the 2
   shopping centers. We argue that the focus of courts on market definition
   is misplaced in markets determined by competitive bottlenecks.},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Prices are increasingly set by algorithms. One concern is that
   intelligent algorithms may learn to collude on higher prices even in the
   absence of the kind of coordination necessary to establish an antitrust
   infringement. However, exactly how this may happen is an open question.
   I show how in simulated sequential competition, competing reinforcement
   learning algorithms can indeed learn to converge to collusive equilibria
   when the set of discrete prices is limited. When this set increases, the
   algorithm considered increasingly converges to supra-competitive
   asymmetric cycles. I show that results are robust to various extensions
   and discuss practical limitations and policy implications.},

   mass advertising/uniform pricing strategy (bench-mark model) to a
   targeted advertising/price discrimination one. Considering a duopoly
   market in which firms simultaneously compete in prices and advertising
   decisions, we examine the competitive and welfare effects of
   personalized pricing with targeted advertising by comparing equilibrium
   outcomes under customized advertising/ pricing decisions to the results
   arising under mass advertising and uniform pricing. We show that, when
   both firms compete in both market segments, all segment consumers are
   expected to pay higher average prices under the personalized
   advertising/pricing strategy. We also show that, in the context of our
   simultaneous game, targeted advertising with price discrimination might
   boost firms' profits in comparison to the case of mass advertising and
   uniform prices. The overall welfare effects of the personalized strategy
   are ambiguous. However, even when the personalized strategy boosts
   overall welfare, consumers might all be worse-off. Thus the paper gives
   support to concerns that have been raised re-garding the firms' ability
   to adopt personalized strategies to boost profits at the expense of
   consumers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A fixation on `scaling up' has captured current innovation discourses
   and, with it, political and economic life at large. Perhaps most visible
   in the rise of platform technologies, big data and concerns about a new
   era of monopolies, scalability thinking has also permeated public policy
   in the search for solutions to `grand societal challenges',
   `mission-oriented innovation' or transformations through experimental
   `living labs'. In this paper, we explore this scalability zeitgeist as a
   key ordering logic of current initiatives in innovation and public
   policy. We are interested in how the explicit preoccupation with
   scalability reconfigures political and economic power by invading
   problem diagnoses and normative understandings of how society and social
   change function. The paper explores three empirical sites - platform
   technologies, living labs and experimental development economics - to
   analyze how scalability thinking is rationalized and operationalized. We
   suggest that social analysis of science and technology needs to come to
   terms with the `politics of scaling' as a powerful corollary of the
   `politics of technology', lest we accept the permanent absence from key
   sites where decisions about the future are made. We focus in on three
   constitutive elements of the politics of scaling: solutionism,
   experimentalism and future-oriented valuation. Our analysis seeks to
   expand our vocabulary for understanding and questioning current modes of
   innovation that increasingly value scaling as an end in itself, and to
   open up new spaces for alternative trajectories of social
   transformation.},

Abstract = {Personal data is no longer just personal. Social networks and pervasive
   environmental surveillance via cellphones and the Internet of Things
   extract minute by minute details of our behavior and cognition. This
   information accumulates into a valuable asset. It then circulates among
   data brokers, targeted advertisers, political campaigns, and even
   foreign states as fuel for predictive interventions that shape
   individuals' lives, often for the worse. Rich gains flow to firms that
   are best positioned to leverage these new information aggregates. The
   privacy losses, economic exploitation, structural inequalities, and
   democratic backsliding produced by personal data economies, however,
   fall upon society at large.
   This Article proposes a novel regulatory intervention to mitigate the
   harms that result from transforming personal data into an asset. States
   and municipalities should create `` public trusts{''} as governance
   vehicles for their residents' locational and personal data. An asset in
   public trust is owed and managed by the state-although it can be in the
   physical custody of private actors. The state can permit its use, and
   even allow limited alienation, provided that doing so benefits a broad
   public rather than a handful of firms. Unique among the legal
   interventions proposed for new data economies, a public trust for data
   allows a democratic polity to durably commit to public-regarding
   management of its informational commons, coupled to judicially
   enforceable limits on private exploitation and public allocation
   decisions. At the same time, because data remains in the physical
   custody of private actors, state actors cannot use it for undemocratic
   or repressive ends. The public trust itself is a common law doctrine of
   ancient roots. It was revived in the Progressive Era as an instrument to
   protect public assets against private exploitation. Both federal and
   state courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have since endorsed a
   variety of doctrinal formulations. The result today is a rich repertoire
   of rules and remedies for the management of commonly held property.
   Personal data, usefully, has many similarities to assets long managed by
   public trust. And familiar justifications for creation of a public trust
   logically extend to personal data. Indeed, municipalities in the United
   States, Europe, and Canada have started to experiment with limited forms
   of a public trust in data. Generalizing from those experiences, this
   Article offers a `` proof of concept{''} for how personal data economies
   can be leashed through the public trust form-a mechanism for minimizing
   private harms while preventing abusive state action.},

Abstract = {It seems intuitively obvious that firms in supply chains may have more
   to gain than to lose from learning to cooperate; but it is now more than
   two decades since Poirier {[}1999. Advanced Supply Chain Management. San
   Francisco, CA: Barrett-Koehler] and others called for cooperation in
   order to capture mutual gains in supply networks and even now
   `cooperation is neither common nor easy'. The simple fact is that not
   only are supply chains exceptionally complex but so too is the `process
   of cooperating' - often in the context of antitrust legislation and
   competition policy. This paper argues that there is a critical need to
   rethink the principles and processes of cooperation within the broader
   framework of the competitive behaviour of firms and business strategy.
   Particularly, it suggests that the relatively recent thinking of
   Greenwald and Kahn {[}2005. Competition Demystified A Radically
   Simplified Approach to Business Strategy. New York, NY: Portfolio, The
   Penguin Group] in their `radically simplified approach to business
   strategy' offers sound conceptual insights into cooperation and
   cooperative strategies for firms not only in markets but also in chains.
   Furthermore, it notes that the analytical framework for cooperation and
   cooperative strategies which the authors develop is far removed from the
   notion of cooperation as `commitment and trust and shared thinking' and
   from `buyer/seller reciprocity' and `collaborative attitudes' which tend
   to underwrite much contemporary thinking and research. The paper also
   argues that the Greenwald and Kahn framework - its single intelligence
   model of cooperation and cooperative strategies - resonates with
   real-world relevance, at least for particular supply chains. The paper
   focuses attention on research into globally significant export coal
   chains from major east coast Australian ports and in brief case studies
   finds substantial alignment between concept and practice.},

Abstract = {The ECJ has not so far developed a single, consistent approach to cases
   in which the right to access official documents is exercised by
   individuals and organisations pursuing their individual cause (private
   watchdogs). While in some cases the Luxembourg jurisprudence has
   followed a restrictive approach, supporting interests and secondary law
   provisions conflicting with transparency, in other it has
   unconditionally endorsed a supreme character of the access right. This
   contribution confronts both of the approaches whenever the access right
   exercised by private watchdogs has clashed with confidentiality stemming
   from secondary law provisions: from state aid, staff rules, data
   protection, antitrust and beyond. The article argues that most often the
   judicial standard restricting the access right interferes with a
   feedback relationship between transparency, accountability and the rule
   of law. This relationship, when properly construed and appraised, may
   form a basis for an arguably more uniform and stable judicial standard.},

Title = {The Myth of Free},
Journal = {GEORGE WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {86},
Number = {2},
Pages = {513-586},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Myths matter. This Article is the first to confront a powerful myth that
   pervades modern economic, technological, and legal discourse: the Myth
   of Free. The prevailing view is that consumers capture massive welfare
   surplus from a flood of innovative new products that are offered free of
   charge. Economists, legal scholars, and industry stakeholders created an
   origin story-a myth-to explain how these products became ``Free.{''}
   But that orthodox origin story is fatally flawed. This Article
   formalizes, then debunks, the Myth of Free and its underlying
   assumptions. The Myth is riddled with internal inconsistencies, logical
   errors, and factual inaccuracies. In their place, this Article provides
   a revisionist history of Free, one that offers greater descriptive and
   predictive accuracy. Along the way, it solves several puzzles: Why has
   Free become the default online business model? Why does the age of
   abundance-so often predicted-always fail to materialize? And why is
   society nonetheless drawn to such predictions?
   The task is urgent: the Myth of Free is not benign. It has misled courts
   into granting protected legal status to Free-product suppliers in cases
   ranging from contract disputes to antitrust and privacy litigation. It
   has also motivated policy proposals that call for eliminating market
   interventions-or competitive markets themselves-without adequate
   justification in either case. Moreover, policies designed for a
   post-scarcity world necessarily overlook the persistent problems
   attendant to scarcity, thereby creating substantial allocative
   inefficiencies. This Article seeks to dispel the Myth of Free before it
   can wreak further harm to societal welfare and the rule of law.},

Abstract = {We model how a technology that perfectly predicts one of two stochastic
   demand shocks alters the character and sustainability of collusion. Our
   results show that mechanisms that reduce firms' uncertainty about the
   true level of demand have ambiguous welfare implications for consumers
   and firms alike. An exogenous improvement in firms' ability to predict
   demand may make collusion possible where it was previously unsustainable
   or more profitable where it previously existed. However, an increase in
   transparency also may make collusion impracticable where it had been
   possible. The intuition for this ambiguity is that greater clarity about
   the true state of demand raises the payoffs both to colluding and to
   cheating. Our findings on the ambiguous welfare implications of reduced
   uncertainty contribute to the emerging literature on how algorithms,
   artificial intelligence (AI), and ``big data{''} in market intelligence
   applications may affect competition.},

Abstract = {This Article examines the unprecedented and deeply underestimated global
   power that the European Union is exercising through its legal
   institutions and standards, and how it successfully exports that
   influence to the rest of the world. Without the need to use
   international institutions or seek other nations' cooperation, the EU
   has a strong and growing ability to promulgate regulations that become
   entrenched in the legal frameworks of developed and developing markets
   alike, leading to a notable ``Europeanization{''} of many important
   aspects of global commerce. The Article identifies the precise
   conditions for and the specific mechanism through which this
   externalization of EU's standards unfolds. Enhanced understanding of
   these conditions and this mechanism helps explain why the EU is
   currently the only jurisdiction that can wield unilateral influence
   across a number of areas of law-ranging from antitrust and privacy to
   health and environmental regulation-and why the markets, other states,
   and international institutions can do little to constrain Europe's
   global regulatory power.},

Abstract = {Law and social science scholars have long elucidated ways of governing
   built around state governance of populations and subjects. Yetmany are
   now grappling with the growing prevalence of practices of governance
   that depart, to varying degrees, from received models. The profusion of
   digital data, and the deployment of machine learning in its analysis,
   are redirecting states' and international organizations' attention away
   from the governance of populations as such and toward the amassing,
   analysis, and mobilization of hybrid data repositories and real-time
   data flows for governance. Much of this work does not depend on state
   data sources or on conventional statistical models. The subjectivities
   nurtured by these techniques of governance are frequently not those of
   choosing individuals. Digital objects and mediators are increasingly
   prevalent at all scales. This article surveys how scholars are beginning
   to understand the nascent political technologies associated with this
   shift toward governance by data.},

Abstract = {In a world marked by financial instability, limited growth, rising
   inequality, deteriorating environment, growing corporate consolidation,
   and political turmoil, calls are made to shift the dominant competition
   law paradigm towards new directions. These may bring competition law
   beyond its usual comfort zone of assessing business, or government,
   practices from the point of view of their effect on prices, output and,
   more broadly, on consumer welfare.
   Competition law is seen as a tool to be used in various circumstances in
   order to correct market as well as non-market (e.g. government)
   failures, that result from restrictions of competition, to the extent
   that these affect social welfare. These failures may relate to the
   protection of personal data and privacy, the protection of the
   environment, the promotion of social mobility, the harnessing of
   disruptive innovation, or the mitigation of technology risks. Some go
   even further and argue that competition law may well be employed in
   order to preserve a number of other values of social justice, thought to
   be intrinsic in democratic capitalism and the liberal order, and to
   which competition law should be sensitive.
   By putting forward the model of polycentric competition law and by
   explaining how this compares with the mainstream monocentric vision that
   has prevailed so far, the study aims to unveil and portray the rites of
   passage in this transition, and to explore the liminal condition of
   modern competition law.},

Abstract = {The US residential broadband market is commonly characterized as a
   duopoly consisting of telephone carriers (digital subscriber lines) and
   cable TV operators (cable modems). The implication is drawn that market
   power obtains; this, in turn, drives recommendations for new competition
   policy remedies. Yet, market power cannot be directly deduced from
   market shares or price-cost margins. We develop an economic analysis
   that examines both static and dynamic factors in considering market
   power, finding that fixed broadband providers do not appear to generate
   supra-competitive returns. Public policies to regulate broadband
   providers should be informed by these marketplace conditions.},

Abstract = {European Administrative Networks (EANs) are well-studied platforms of
   collaboration between national authorities. To understand EANs, the
   literature typically relies on few explanatory variables: network
   origins, objectives, and outputs. This external view of EANs leaves
   important questions unanswered, notably concerning power redistribution
   and regulators' perception of EANs. This article highlights the
   importance of network internal structures as an explanatory variable for
   understanding EANs. We contend that internal structures are `opportunity
   structures' for regulators to set agendas and share resources. We
   investigate the case of the European Competition Network (ECN) - a
   highly structured, hierarchical and formalized enforcement network -
   drawing on structured interviews with 15 National Competition Agencies
   (NCAs) carried out in 2014. We find that the ECN's formal internal
   structures afford all NCAs access to the agenda, foster perceptions of
   effectiveness, and promote informal sharing of expertise outside the
   network. Future research should incorporate internal structures into
   analyses of administrative networks.},

Abstract = {Can industrial policy be good policy? Can it be market-conforming (not
   producing market distortions via misallocation of resources) and
   market-ensuring (e.g. via antitrust or enforcement of property rights)?
   Can it create a smaller market distortion to prevent a larger one that
   might result from political ferment? This chapter explores issues of the
   definition of industrial policy, discusses market failure vs. government
   failure in specific industries, contrasts the options for industrial
   policy in regulatory states with those available in developmental
   states, and provides examples to illustrate these issues based on the
   author's empirical research on biotechnology, high definition and
   digital television, flat panel displays, semiconductors, software, and
   cellular telephones.},

Title = {When prohibiting wholesale price-parity agreements may harm consumers
   {*}},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {76},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We study the competitive and welfare effects of wholesale price-parity
   agreements. These contracts prevent a monopolist, who sells its product
   to final consumers both directly and indirectly through alternative
   distribution channels, to charge different input (wholesale) prices to
   competing intermediaries (e.g., platforms). In a multi-channel and
   multi-layered industry, organized as an agency business model, we find
   that the monopolist and the intermediaries do not necessarily have
   aligned incentives concerning the introduction of wholesale
   price-parity. While these agreements always hurt the monopolist, they
   may benefit the intermediaries when competition between the direct and
   the indirect distribution channels is sufficiently intense. Moreover,
   when this is the case, in contrast to retail price parity agreements
   that typically reduce consumer welfare, wholesale price-parity may also
   benefit consumers.

Abstract = {Bug-bounty programs have the potential to harvest the effort and diverse

   them at scale is challenging due to misaligned incentives and

   detail and present relevant empirical data. We develop an economic
   framework consisting of two models that focus on evaluating different
   policies for improving the effectiveness of bug-bounty programs.
   Further, we discuss regulatory policy challenges and questions related
   to vulnerability research and disclosure, such as mandatory bug bounties
   and the relation to other cybersecurity policies.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to explore not only the greatness of Patterson but also
   some of the mistakes he made along the way.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study traces the career of John Patterson, founder and president of
   the National Cash Register (NCR) from 1884 to 1922. Data from many
   different sources, some only recently available through the HathiTrust
   Digital Library, are analyzed to provide a systematic and focused
   examination of Patterson's greatness, as well as some errors in judgment
   he during his lengthy leadership at NCR.
   Findings
   John Patterson recognized the potential development of a new global
   industry before it existed and went to work creating it. After he bought
   the original patents for the cash register, he spent huge sums on
   research and development and secured hundreds of additional patents on
   the device. He also spent a fortune on educational advertising to create
   market demand where none previously existed and invested heavily in
   developing his salesforce through a strong focus on training,
   professionalism and high commissions. He also engaged in many unsavory
   sales practices to try to keep others from encroaching on what he
   considered his exclusive right to the cash register market. At one
   point, he was convicted in a criminal proceeding for those efforts and
   sentenced to prison.
   Originality/value
   This is the first paper to provide a balanced review of Patterson's
   contributions to the business history of that era from a sales and
   marketing perspective. The paper may be of interest to marketing
   scholars and practitioners, as well as business historians.},

Abstract = {The natural consequence of finding an infringement of Article 102 TFEU
   is to offset the harm to consumer welfare by restoring competition
   through effective remedies. As big data constitutes the most vital
   resource in data-driven markets, a dominant undertaking can exclude its
   rivals from accessing user data and thus deprive them of scale in
   markets that are characterized by network effects. Indeed, the European
   Commission found Google guilty of excluding its rivals in the Android
   licencing case by adopting this strategy. The Commission, however, did
   not impose any data sharing remedy. This article analyses the viability
   of mandatory data sharing as a remedy to restore competition in the
   affected market. It approaches this research question from both
   theoretical and practical standpoints. It analyses the viability of a
   mandatory data sharing remedy from a legal, economic, and technological
   perspective. A separate section makes an assessment of such a remedy
   within the framework of the GDPR. Based on this investigation, this
   article concludes that mandatory data sharing is not the optimal
   solution to remedy loss to consumer welfare.},

Abstract = {The German Federal Supreme Court (BGH) held that the use of narrow price
   parity clauses (NPCs) between Booking.com and hotels infringed Art. 101
   Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), confirming the
   Federal Cartel Office's decision. The Supreme Court based its judgment
   mainly on the following grounds: (1) the use of these clauses restricts
   intra and inter-brand competition between hotels; (2) NPCs cannot be
   considered an ancillary restraint in the sense of Art. 101(1) TFEU; and
   (3) avoiding free-riding through these clauses cannot be considered as a
   justifying efficiency in the present case under Art. 101(3) TFEU. The
   present comment focuses on the analysis of the Court regarding (3) and
   argues that the reasoning in the judgment made conceptual mistakes and
   statements against settled EU law. The case shows the difficulties the
   Court had in handling a case where dynamic considerations are important.
   Therefore, even though the Court may have had valid concerns regarding
   NPCs, the judgment at hand is a step in the wrong direction regarding
   the judicial function of guidance of undertakings throughout the economy
   that wish to comply with competition law.},

Abstract = {The analysis of the fourth industrial revolution outlines the structural
   changes arising in industries, as described by firm managers, scientists
   and consultants, as well as the literature on the fourth industrial
   revolution. It raises the need for new industrial policies, which are
   discussed in this paper. Structural changes arising in specific
   industries might have effects on other industries (due to
   complementarities) and on the whole economic system. Industrial policy
   must therefore be based on an analysis of productive processes, but also
   on analyses of the interactions between different productive processes.
   Favoring structural changes in one sector may have positive or negative
   impacts on other sectors; it may also impact upon the labour market,
   changing the skill required in the labour force, as well as wages. We
   argue that industrial policies are particularly needed when the economy
   experiences deep transformations, such as industrial revolutions. The
   advent of digital globalization is primarily driven by the technological
   progress induced by the fourth industrial revolution, but we believe
   that industrial revolutions are the result of complex transformations of
   the economy, the society and culture. We define industrial policy in a
   broad manner, as a set of actions aimed to favor structural changes in
   industries and orientating industrial development in specific
   directions. Such actions regard innovation, trade, intellectual property
   rights and antitrust; they also regard labour, because firms cannot
   upgrade or be created if they do not find the human capital they need
   for their operations. Looking at providing appropriate human capital
   means considering social policies, labour contracts and measures to
   favor the participation in the labour force. It also means considering
   education and training, because they determine the types of skills
   people will be able to develop.},

Abstract = {The policies surrounding the Internet in the United States are
   determined by what the wealthiest and most powerful players wish to have
   happen. This is producing a digital world that is inimical to democracy
   and to the revolutionary potential of these technologies. The author
   argues for radical policies: the nationalization of the ISP/cellphone
   industry and its conversion to a public utility; the nationalization of
   huge Internet monopolies that are impervious to antitrust; the adoption
   of a massive public subsidy to pay for independent, competitive,
   uncensored, noncommercial news media. The author points out that these
   proposals have a basis in conservative theory as well as radical and
   liberal democratic theory. It is imperative to broaden the debate and

Abstract = {We study a firm's choice between online and physical markets with
   respect to product quality. We analyze two contrasting driving forces:
   On the one hand, online consumers cannot physically inspect the products
   prior to purchase. This provides the firm with the incentive to hide
   low-quality products online. On the other hand, consumer reviews and the
   larger market size may attract higher qualities to the online market.
   Using a simple yet flexible framework, we show that the firm's choice of
   a marketplace can disclose or hide product quality. If marginal cost is
   convex in quality, the firm's choice will be characterized by a cut-off
   quality level, below which the firm will choose the online market. If
   marginal cost is concave in quality, both high-end and low-end qualities
   may choose the online market, leaving the physical market to
   intermediate qualities. Overall, we show that consumer reviews can
   alleviate, but do not eliminate, the ``lemons problem{''}. The pooling
   result in the case of concave-in-quality marginal cost provides a caveat
   for empirically testing the effectiveness of online consumer-review
   mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Landscape is a complex of interacting ecosystems and humans. Conflicting
   interests among various actors with different values and rationalities
   occurs. A board game, the Landscape Game, was developed based on game
   theory to help understand the dynamics of land competition, policy
   measures and sustainability of a landscape. This game introduces
   landscape conservation, development, environmental services risks and
   investment alternatives. The game challenges rational players to
   maximize their revenues, while at the same time sustaining the
   landscape. Through this game, various policy instruments, e.g. rules,
   taxes, land use incentives and disincentives were tested. The game play
   results show the easiness in harmonising sustainability and development
   when productivity is low. If productivity increases then landscape
   sustainability can either increase or reduce, affected by government
   policies and players' actions. Lessons learned from the game can trigger
   changes in players' mental model. The digital version of the game
   provides opportunities for its wider use.},

Abstract = {This article provides insights on how to manage collective innovation in
   the digital economy, an innovation regime which is riddled with complex
   regulatory challenges and increasing litigation over intellectual
   property rights. Private collective organizations face two main
   challenges: (1) to promote collective innovation while preserving the
   private interests of the firms within the collective, and (2) to ensure
   that collective innovation does not weaken healthy competition. Through
   a case study of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), an
   exemplary private collective federation of organizations composed of
   standardization bodies, industry consortia and technology producers, we
   identify organizational solutions to these challenges. We find that a
   combination of specific IP rights instruments is key to manage these
   trade-offs. We also find that the combined policies of essential
   patenting, FRAND, and maximum royalty rate help overcome the specific
   challenges associated with collective innovation within competitive
   contexts. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings for
   managers and for policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {While the proliferation of online markets has presented competition
   authorities with a string of challenges of diverse nature, the price
   parity phenomenon depicts particularly well the Commission's
   `fight-chaos-with-chaos' approach to digital economy. Indeed, the EU
   watchdog's passive attitude towards the multiple enquiries into
   most-favoured-nation clauses by different national trustbusters across
   the Old Continent risks going down in universal history of antitrust
   infamy. With the awareness that rivers of ink have already been poured
   over the subject, this paper adopts a brand new stance by looking on its
   opportunity side. In the light of the timid open-mindedness recently
   shown by the European Court of Justice as regards the object-effect
   dichotomy in Groupement des Cartes Bancaires and Maxima Latvija
   judgements (which seem to steer away from Pierre Fabre's sternness), I
   will discuss different national solutions with a view to vindicating not
   only a more consistent but also an unprejudiced effects-based approach
   that should transport analogue EU law enforcement to the digital era.},

Title = {Social Dialogue and the regulatory power of governing bodies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL SPORTS LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {119-127},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {EU Social Dialogue is an institutionalised set of procedural
   arrangements that can be used to establish a supranational governance in
   a broad range of policy fields. Sectoral Social Dialogue constitutes a
   platform for European representatives on the side of employers and
   employees to discuss matters of common interest. Arrangements concluded
   in this forum may be ratified by the EU institutions and translated into
   binding agreements. Where these would constitute collective bargaining
   agreements, they would escape the application of competition law, in
   light of the social policy that they pursue. The supranational nature of
   the EU Social Dialogue makes it particularly suitable in the sporting
   sector. Sport is an industry regulated at transnational level, and the
   differences within labour disciplines in Member States prevent greater
   integration. In a system where private regulators set rules that have to
   be applied and enforced within Member States, Social Dialogue is the
   best possible instrument to guarantee greater representation of athletes
   in the governance of the system. A sectoral Social Dialogue in football
   has been already put in place, but, so far, it has only produced
   arrangement player contract minimum requirements. This paper submits
   that a greater use of Social Dialogue in the sporting sector would
   enhance the participation of stakeholders in the setting of rules that

Abstract = {Fifteen OECD countries, ten of which EU members, have regulation for
   fixing the price of printed books. At least eight of these have extended
   such regulation to e-books. This article investigates the cultural and
   economic arguments as well as the legal context concerning a fixed price
   for e-books and deals with the question of how the arguments for and
   against retail price maintenance for e-books should be weighted in the
   light of the evidence. It concludes that while the evidence in defence
   of a fixed price for printed books is slim at best, the case for a fixed
   price for e-books is weaker still while the legal acceptability within
   EU law is disputable. Against this background, introducing a fixed price
   for e-books is ill-advised.},

Abstract = {Alfred E. Kahn was an observer and practitioner of telecommunications
   regulation as technology changed the industry from a natural monopoly to
   a platform-based oligopoly among telephone, cable, satellite, and
   wireless carriers. Regulation and legislation were slow to recognize
   these changes, and large welfare losses occurred, some of which could
   have been avoided if regulators, legislators and economists had followed
   Fred's economic advice: Prices must be informed by costs; the relevant
   costs are actual incremental costs; costs and prices are an outcome of a
   Schumpeterian competitive process, not the starting point; excluding
   firms from markets is fundamentally anticompetitive; a reliance on
   imperfect markets subject to antitrust law is preferable to necessarily
   imperfect regulation; and a regulatory transition to deregulation
   entails propensities to micromanage the process to generate preferred
   outcomes, visible competitors, and expedient price reductions.},

Abstract = {With the digitalization of the financial market, dealers are
   increasingly handling market-making activities by algorithms. Recent
   antitrust literature raises concerns on collusion caused by artificial
   intelligence. This paper studies the possibility of cooperation between
   market makers via independent Q-learning. with inventory risk is
   formulated as a repeated general-sum game. Under a stag-hunt type
   payoff, we find that market makers can learn cooperative strategies
   without communication. In general, high spreads can have the largest
   probability even when the lowest spread is the unique Nash equilibrium.
   Moreover, introducing more agents into the game does not necessarily
   eliminate the presence of supra-competitive spreads.},

Abstract = {Since the typical franchise arrangements permit the more powerful
   franchisors to simultaneously act as suppliers as well as competitors to
   their franchisees, apprehensions about potential opportunistic behaviors
   and allegations of antitrust violations are not uncommon.  In turn, this
   unique structuring of franchises with dual distribution has drawn
   considerable scrutiny from the public policy platform.  In particular,
   the ownership redirection hypothesis-that the powerful franchisors will
   reacquire the best franchised outlets relegating only the marginal units
   to franchisees-has received special attention because it verbalizes the
   worst fears associated with franchising.  This paper provides an
   evaluation of this hypothesis.  To do so, we examine (1) the key
   premises of the hypothesis from the perspectives of a number of related
   literatures and (2) the available empirical evidence on the hypothesis. 
   Both aspects of the appraisal point to a number of unresolved issues
   with important public policy implications.},

Abstract = {We point to deficits in current global institutional arrangements in
   support of agricultural development and food and nutrition security. A
   framework for global institutional arrangements proposed here is the set
   of essential international public goods for a well-functioning world
   food system. These public goods include international natural resource
   management; trade and transboundary competition policy; research and
   innovation; handling large scale food emergencies; and transboundary
   food safety. Based on the framework, and institutional economics
   considerations, causes of current malfunctioning of global food
   governance are analyzed. It is proposed to redesign global food
   governance by establishing an international platform with policy
   clusters mapped along the set of global public goods. To support the
   platform with needed research-based evidence an International Panelon
   Food, Nutrition and Agriculture (IPFNA) is suggested, partly following
   the design of the Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change (IPCC).
   Existing organizations and mechanisms would form building blocks of the
   strengthened and redesigned governance system. A gradual approach toward
   redesign is proposed. Some redesign in the suggested direction was
   triggered by the food crisis of 2008, as demonstrated by the reform of
   the Committee on Food Security (CFS) with its high level panel of
   experts, but more is needed.},

Abstract = {Free market is implemented across nations as it has been proven that
   competitiveness can contribute to better products and services being
   offered. In addition, it can provide more accurate pricing and overall
   enhanced wellbeing for society. In the particular case of Europe, the
   free market is promoted and there are some sectors where regulation is
   in place to ensure competitiveness. In this context, e-collaboration and
   e-services have proven to be a tool that enables free market
   competition, more so than governmental regulations. Through the
   particular case of transportation services in Spain, the present study
   evaluates how e-services such as transportation apps contribute to a
   wider variety of choices for consumers, enabling free market competition
   despite of complaints by traditional workers in the sector. Results show
   the positive changes in the transportation sector thanks to the
   introduction of e-collaboration and digital services.},

Title = {How Can European Regulation on ESG Impact Business Globally?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The European Union (EU) has impacted regulation worldwide in areas
   ranging from data protection to trade or antitrust. In select fields, it
   has defined stringent standards and has had an impact on global business
   because of the size of its market and the price of participating in it.
   The purpose of this paper is to analyze the main provisions of the EU
   regulation on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and determine
   whether and how it will have an impact on business globally, including
   regulations around disclosure for companies, taxonomy for the asset
   management sector, supply chain due diligence requirements, new
   mechanisms such as carbon markets, or non-tariffs restrictions on
   international trade. For this, our analysis includes an in-depth review
   of the literature on EU regulation of the past 20 years, complemented
   with interviews with experts in the field, in order to understand the
   main tools used by European policymakers in ESG regulations to
   understand their effect. The analysis adds to the body of research
   pertaining to the impact of regulation on business and the growing body
   of research on sustainable finance. We find that the new ESG regulation
   impacts countries outside of the EU, influencing regulation worldwide,
   and raising the question of possible regulatory arbitrage.},

Abstract = {With the swift progress of Internet technology, the way to get access to
   copyrighted work is undergoing substantial change. A variety of
   licensing models, usually operated by intermediaries, such as Spotify or
   Pandora, have emerged. What are the impacts of such new models on the
   end users of the music? Will they generate anticompetitive concerns? The
   chapter examines the currently popular music licensing models from the
   perspective of competition law and concludes that the key players such
   as Apple and Tencent have a strong position in the music market. It is
   not certain whether such key players have a dominant market position,
   and this needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. However, some
   conduct of the licensing intermediaries may fall within the subject of
   antitrust scrutiny if the requirement of dominant position is satisfied.
   Particularly, in the new era of ``crossover{''}, high tech giants such
   as Apple, Tencent and Alibaba are building up content libraries, and
   pose serious threat to their rivals without synthesized platforms.
   (Synthesized platform refers to the online services that provide a wide
   range of services, which may cover instant messaging, information
   portals, online games, online music, e-business etc. Such synthesizing
   has significant impacts on consumers' switching cost.) Competition law
   should adopt a more flexible approach to define the ``relevant
   market{''} in order to protect market competition.},

Title = {Mergers and Wages in Digital Networks: a Public Interest Perspective},

Abstract = {This article has examined the relationship between mergers and their
   impact on average per-person wages for incumbents, over long periods of
   institutional changes within the United States telecommunications
   industry, from a public interest perspective. We evaluate the
   relationship of mergers and wages across two differing periods; one,
   when the sector was completely regulated, and, the other, when
   competition was introduced after the Telecommunications Act of 1996. We
   treat mergers as endogenous and use treatment effects analysis to
   examine the relationship of mergers and wages. Having split the data set
   into data for regulated and deregulated periods, we find no impact of
   mergers on wages in the regulated period. In the deregulated period,
   however, between 1996 and 2001, we find a significant negative impact on
   mergers and wages. For firms experiencing mergers, real average wages
   per employee are a third lower than in non-merging firms. This suggests
   a post-merger cost-cutting approach by firms. Our before-and-after
   findings of wages declining after mergers, in the 1996 to 2001 period,
   lead us to conclude that the merger approvals given after the passage of
   TA 1996 will not have met public interest guidelines as per which merger
   outcomes ought to be fair to affected firms' employees and stakeholders.
   Additionally, we suggest a resolution to the empirical puzzle, of
   half-negative and half-positive merger and wage outcome findings
   existing in the literature, by incorporating institutional context into
   our analysis to explain why during some periods of time the relationship
   of merger and wage outcomes may be positive and at other times may be
   negative.},

Abstract = {We present a continuous-time generalization of the seminal research and
   development model of d'Aspremont and Jacquemin (Am Econ Rev
   78(5):1133-1137, 1988) to examine the trade-off between the benefits of
   allowing firms to cooperate in research and the corresponding increased
   potential for product market collusion. We show the existence of a
   solution to the optimal investment problem using a combination of
   results from viscosity theory and the theory of planar dynamical
   systems. In particular, we show that there is a critical level of
   marginal cost at which firms are indifferent between doing nothing and
   starting to develop the technology. We find that colluding firms develop
   further a wider range of initial technologies, pursue innovations more
   quickly, and are less likely to abandon a technology. Product market
   collusion could thus yield higher total surplus.},

Abstract = {Main objective of the article - assessment of problems and opportunities
   of speeding up of world economic growth in the context of the crisis
   phenomena and turbulence in economy. Complication and reformatting of
   the economic relations between the countries represents serious
   challenges for modern economic dynamics. Methodological approach of the
   authors is based on assessment of the defining influence of new factors
   on delay of economic activity and economic development. The thesis about
   the defining impact of international trade on economic growth is called
   into question. It was analyzed the value and a role of the international
   companies as growth catalysts in the conditions of new technological
   revolution. It is established that risks of development of the world
   economy continue to increase, and the main of them - in decline in labor
   productivity in the developed countries, uncertainty concerning interest
   rates and economic policy of the states, the universal growth of
   sovereign and corporate debt of the states. It is shown that China has
   the increasing problems with the growth; however the flexibility of its
   economic policy allows to connect additional mechanisms of speeding up
   of social and economic development. In the European Union economic
   growth depends on the solution of problems of consolidation of the
   budgetary process, decrease in a debt, and in general - on reforming of
   the existing model of social and economic development. Prospects of
   economic dynamics will depend in many respects on stability of trade
   relations between the countries, and on the effective international
   cooperation directed to overcoming imbalances of the modern world
   economy. Opportunities and problems of an exit of developing countries
   to a trajectory of sustained economic growth in the conditions of
   digitalization and digital transformations in the world economy are
   estimated. Aggravation of a problem of inequality in the conditions of
   digitalization of the world economy is possible to overcome, however a
   number of measures in the sphere of industrial, innovative and
   regulatory policy is necessary. Also at the international level serious
   reforms in the sphere of financial regulation and taxation are
   necessary. The conclusions received as a result of the research have
   important practical importance as overcoming the problems stated above
   and also trade political differences between the countries will make
   economic growth steady and inclusive.},

Abstract = {This article examines the roots and consequences of public service
   broadcasters' strategic commitment to digital universalism and the
   anything, anywhere, anytime' paradigm of mobile media delivery. Using
   policy analysis, expert interviews and case studies it traces the
   adaptation of national public service broadcaster to global information
   capital, linking broadcasters' pursuit of multiplatform ubiquity with
   competition policy, the rise of ubiquitous computing and its commercial
   realization in global mobile media markets. It then analyses the
   challenges of implementing a public sector mobile agenda in the
   Australian context, where the scope of mobile broadband uptake is
   internationally significant. The analysis explores the dynamics of
   mobile media planning and investment at the Australian Broadcasting
   Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service, identifying new
   expressions of universalism in online access and accessibility, new
   costs in research, design, development and delivery, and significant
   debates emerging around the prioritization, privatization and
   commercialization of public resources.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE},

Volume = {51},
Number = {5},
Pages = {787-816},
Abstract = {As the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) hangs in balance, an
   evaluation of what it offers could inform current decisions and shape
   future negotiations. The TPP's services component has been hailed as one
   of the agreement's major accomplishments. To assess the agreement's
   impact on national policy in the major services sectors, we created a
   new public database. This database reveals that TPP commitments seldom
   go beyond countries' applied policies, suggesting the explicit
   liberalization resulting from the agreement is limited only to a few
   countries and a few areas. However, the TPP enhances transparency and
   policy certainty because parties' services commitments cover more
   trading partners, more sectors and are in some cases closer to applied
   policies than their commitments under previous agreements. Furthermore,
   new TPP rules, including on state-owned enterprises, government
   procurement and competition policy, could enhance services market
   access. In particular, the TPP breaks new ground in prohibiting
   restrictions on international data flows, while at the same time
   creating unprecedented obligations on all parties to protect consumers
   from fraud and protect privacy. These dual obligations on importing and
   exporting countries represent a model for regulatory cooperation that
   could elicit greater market opening if applied to other areas.},

Title = {The Revival of Respondeat Superior and Evolution of Gatekeeper Liability},
Journal = {GEORGETOWN LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {109},
Number = {1},
Pages = {141-189},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In an era of servants and masters, respondeat superior emerged to hold
   the powerful accountable for the acts of those they control. That
   doctrine's significance has only grown in an economy driven by large
   corporations that rely heavily on legions of subsidiaries and
   independent contractors, such as banks deploying independent call
   centers, oil companies using drilling contractors, and tech platforms
   connecting consumers to app developers. It is widely believed that firms
   can avoid thirdparty liability for many laws by outsourcing or creating
   subsidiaries.
   This Article shows that common narratives of the demise of third-party
   liability are incomplete. Respondeat superior is alive and well.
   Moreover, in environmental, employment, consumer protection,
   discrimination, and other areas, the law requires large companies to act
   as gatekeepers by regulating third parties. These gatekeepers incur
   liability when they fail to enforce the law. In light of these features,
   the expansion of liability would be aptly described as respondeat
   gatekeeper.
   The task ahead is to understand and reinforce liability's ongoing
   adaptation to a financially and digitally intermediated world. Updating
   courts' analytic tools to include economics and network theory would
   more accurately measure power compared to the current, intuitive
   approach. Moreover, courts should view pervasive technologies of
   control-most importantly surveillance tools and online platforms-as
   stronger evidence of liability. The revival has the potential to
   restructure corporations, markets, and society in a beneficial manner by
   bringing harmful activities, as a matter of law, back within the fold of
   the firm.},

   financial rules},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {439-452},
Abstract = {Korea's developmental state had long maintained the principle of
   separation between industrial capital and financial capital, whereby the
   nation's industrial conglomerates-the chaebol-were restricted from
   having controlling ownership of financial institutions, especially
   banks. The financial crisis of 1997-98 renewed calls for regulating the
   chaebol, especially in terms of reinforcing corporate governance and
   competition policy. This process was supported and promoted by vibrant
   non-governmental organisations led by progressive activists who forged
   an effective alliance with the government and the ruling party whose
   platform followed a populist course. The reform movement has been
   resisted with equal fervour by conservative elements, led by the
   opposition party, chaebol-supported think tanks, and the conservative
   media. This cleavage is evident in the case of a pending legislation on
   chaebol ownership of financial institutions, the Financial Industry
   Structure Law. The controversy over this proposed law demonstrates that
   the contemporary chaebol reforms are deeply politicised. It also
   illustrates the path-dependent nature of the government-chaebol
   relationship.},

Title = {THE CASE FOR RESURRECTING THE FTC ACT'S PENALTY OFFENSE AUTHORITY},
Journal = {UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {170},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-123},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {On April 22, 2021, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Federal
   Trade Commission cannot continue to seek monetary relief from wrongdoers
   through 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act-the authority
   predominantly relied on to challenge lawbreaking in federal court.
   This news followed a string of mounting criticisms in recent years that
   have undermined public confidence in the Agency. A decade ago, after the
   FTC largely stood idle against abuses by subprime lenders, Congress
   stripped the Agency of key authorities over the financial sector. Today,
   concerns about the adequacy of the FTC's antitrust enforcement and about
   its effectiveness as a privacy and data protection watchdog are once
   again raising questions about whether the FTC can protect the public
   from digital abuses.
   Today's crisis of confidence can be traced back to the 1980s. During
   that decade, Chairman James C. Miller III and his lieutenants took
   control of the Commission, and professed faith in the idea that markets
   could be trusted to regulate themselves. They supported crippling cuts
   to the Agency's budget and headcount, while shifting the Commission's
   focus away from combating corporate abuse. They also shelved the
   Commission's strongest tools to deter lawbreaking, turning instead to
   13(b), the authority now limited by the Supreme Court. While 13(b) was
   an important tool, it did not allow the Commission to actually seek
   penalties against wrongdoing, and it is best suited to one-off
   enforcement rather than ensuring compliance market-wide. This has meant
   that for large firms and other established corporate actors, breaking
   the law can be a good bet.
   In this Article, we detail why the Agency should resurrect one of the
   key authorities abandoned in the 1980s: 5(m)(1)(B) of the FTC Act, the
   Penalty Offense Authority. The Penalty O ffense Authority is a unique
   tool in commercial regulation. Typically, first-time offenses involving
   unfair or deceptive practices do not lead to civil penalties. However,
   if the Commission formally condemns these practices in a
   cease-and-desist order, they can become what we call ``Penalty
   Offenses.{''} Other parties that commit these offenses with knowledge
   that they have been condemned by the Commission face financial penalties
   that can add up to a multiple of their illegal profits, rather than a
   fraction.
   Using this authority, the Commission can substantially increase
   deterrence and reduce litigation risk by noticing whole industries of
   Penalty Offenses, exposing violators to significant civil penalties,
   while helping to ensure fairness for honest firms. This would
   dramatically improve the FTC's effectiveness relative to relying
   exclusively on equitable monetary relief and no-money cease and desist
   orders.
   We demonstrate in this Article that in a number of key areas, including
   urgent concerns like online disinformation, the Commission can deploy
   the Penalty Offense Authority immediately. This can increase deterrence,
   since firms will pay a significant price for engaging in unfair or
   deceptive practices previously condemned by the Commission. We also
   outline how the Commission can deploy this authority to combat emerging
   harms, including illegal targeted marketing and deceptive data
   harvesting.
   We close with a call for a broader rethinking of the Commission's
   approach to combatting corporate misconduct. By inventorying its
   existing tools and deploying them strategically, the Commission can
   begin to turn the page on its checkered record and regain the public's
   confidence.},

Abstract = {This paper examines some of the practical questions that the European
   policy and regulatory framework on telecommunications, digital
   television and broadcasting is facing as Internet develops. The paper
   begins by emphasising the underlying principles of the current policy
   framework. It examines general aspects of communications regulation and
   the main pillars of policy (telecommunications, broadcasting, internal
   market and competition policy) in a European context. It is then argued
   that Internet developments do not fundamentally change the basic aims of
   the regulatory framework, rather they tend to reveal where current
   practice is not adequately respecting basic principles. The main part of
   the paper examines a number of practical examples where regulatory
   uncertainty has arisen to illustrate the point. At the same time there
   have been calls for a more systematic treatment of policy in
   anticipation of convergence between telecommunications and broadcasting,
   driven to some extent by Internet developments. The final part of the
   paper briefly highlights some dangers of moving to an approach that
   attempts to be more systematic.},

Title = {Controlled predatory pricing in a multiperiod Stackelberg game: an MPEC

Year = {2011},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {345-362},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We analyze a multiperiod oligopolistic market where each period is a
   Stackelberg game between a leader firm and multiple follower firms. The
   leader chooses his production level first, taking into account the
   reaction of the followers. Then, the follower firms decide their
   production levels after observing the leader's decision. The difference
   between the proposed model and other models discussed in literature is
   that the leader firm has the power to force the follower firms out of
   business by preventing them from achieving a target sales level in a
   given time period. The leader firm has an incentive to lower the market
   prices possibly lower than the Stackelberg equilibrium in order to push
   the followers to sell less and eventually go out of business.
   Intentionally lowering the market prices to force competitors to fail is
   known as predatory pricing, and is illegal under antitrust laws since it
   negatively affects consumer welfare. In this work, we show that there
   exists a predatory pricing strategy where the market price is above the
   average cost and consumer welfare is preserved. We develop a mixed
   integer nonlinear problem (MINLP) that models the multiperiod
   Stackelberg game. The MINLP problem is transformed to a mixed integer
   linear problem (MILP) by using binary variables and piecewise
   linearization. A cutting plane algorithm is used to solve the resulting
   MILP. The results show that firms can engage in predatory pricing even
   if the average market price is forced to remain higher than the average
   cost. Furthermore, we show that in order to protect the consumers,
   antitrust laws can control predatory pricing by setting rules on
   consumer welfare.},

Title = {Extraterritorial Jurisdiction of State and Perception Transformation of
   its Spatial Boundaries},
Journal = {PRAVO-ZHURNAL VYSSHEI SHKOLY EKONOMIKI},
Year = {2019},
Number = {3},
Pages = {160-180},
Abstract = {The grounds for the extraterritorial manifestation of state jurisdiction
   in the context of the transformation of the perception of its
   boundaries. The trend of widespread extraterritorial jurisdiction is
   losing its importance as a ``last level{''} jurisdiction in the modern
   conditions, taking into account possibility of the establishing of
   extraterritorial jurisdiction not only in relation to crimes in the
   sphere of international law, but also in relation to other public-law
   relations such as tax, antitrust, information regulation.As a result of
   the study of current trends in the implementation of legislative,
   judicial, executive powers of one state affecting the significant
   interests of another state, the author has proposed to consider
   extraterritorial jurisdiction in dialectical contradiction. On the one
   hand the international principle of sovereign equality and territorial
   supremacy of states does not allow the outside interference, and on the
   other hand the actual unauthorized extension of the jurisdiction of one
   state in relation to another state takes place. The contradiction
   stipulates the development of restrictive mechanisms for the
   establishment of extraterritorial prescriptive jurisdiction in the form
   of a close connection between the applicable law and an appropriate
   relationship. The subject of the close connection may serve foreigners'
   awareness of regulatory acts providing for extraterritorial scope. An
   illustration of the need to establish this restriction is the activity
   in the non-territorial information and communication space on the
   cyberspace platform that can be subject of jurisdiction of any state in
   the absence of a relationship with the state of the court and awareness
   of foreign law.The article also raises the question of the interrelation
   of extraterritorial judicial jurisdiction and prescriptive jurisdiction
   that allows to establish broad grounds of extraterritorial judicial
   jurisdiction in relation to cross-border private disputes. This is
   explained by the extraterritorial effect of private law applicable to
   these relations. The article analyzes the close connection criterion as
   the basis of extraterritorial judicial jurisdiction, which, in
   theauthor's opinion, is more responsive to modern challenges caused by
   the rapid development of the information society and digital
   technologies.},

Abstract = {In order for a trauma surgeon to have an intelligent discussion with
   hospital administrators, healthcare plans, policy-makers, or any other
   physicians, a basic understanding of the fundamentals of healthcare is
   paramount. It is truly shocking how many surgeons are unable to describe
   the difference between Medicare and Medicaid or describe how hospitals
   and physicians get paid. These topics may seem burdensome but they are
   vital to all business decision making in the healthcare field. The
   following chapter provides further insight about what we call ``the
   basics{''} of providing medical care today. Most of the topics presented
   can be applied to all specialties of medicine. It is broken down into 5
   sections. The first section is a brief overview of government programs,
   their influence on care delivery and reimbursement, and past and future
   legislation. Section 2 focuses on the compliance, care provision, and
   privacy statutes that regulate physicians who care for Medicare/Medicaid
   patient populations. With a better understanding of these obligations,
   section 3 discusses avenues by which physicians can stay informed of
   current and pending health policy and provides ways that they can become
   involved in shaping future legislation. The fourth section changes gears
   slightly by explaining how the concepts of trade restraint, libel,
   antitrust legislation, and indemnity relate to physician practice. The
   fifth, and final, section ties all of components together by describing
   how physician-hospital alignment can be mutually beneficial in providing
   patient care under current healthcare policy legislation.},

Abstract = {We examine the influence of firms' ability to employ individualized
   pricing on the welfare consequences of horizontal mergers. In a
   two-to-one merger, the merger reduces consumer surplus more when firms
   can price discriminate based on individual preferences compared to when
   they cannot. However, the opposite holds true in a three-to-two merger,
   in which the reduction in consumer surplus is substantially lower with
   individualized pricing than with uniform pricing. Further, the merger
   requires an even smaller marginal cost reduction to justify when an
   upstream data provider can make exclusive offers for its data to
   downstream firms. We also show that exclusive contracts for consumer
   data pose significant antitrust concerns independent of merger
   considerations. Implications for vertical integration and data mergers
   are drawn.},

Journal = {WORLD COMPETITION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Pages = {451-474},
Abstract = {This article argues through a US/EU comparative assessment of the
   intellectual property (IP) law goals and competition law goals that
   whilst the overarching goals of competition law and IP rights to enhance
   overall economic welfare are still complementary, internal conflicts
   within the two legal spheres are jeopardizing the achievement of these
   goals.
   Within the IP laws the private/public reward/incentive to innovate
   equilibrium is now being tilted in favour of private interests due to
   recent developments in terms of rapid innovation in digital economy
   markets and technologies coupled with an expansion of IP rights and
   increase in patents grants and their width.
   This has a knock-on effect on the application of the competition rules
   as a second-tier regulator of IP rights. However, the competition rules
   also face its own battle in keeping up with the fast-developing digital
   economy, the concerns regarding Big Data and online platforms raising
   questions about the sustainability of the `consumer welfare' framework
   as an optimal standard to ensure effective competition in these markets.
   Consequently, there is a danger that the competition rules and the IP
   rights will be out of quilter, risking stifling of innovation and harm
   to consumer welfare, unless adjustment is made within the two legal
   spheres.},

Abstract = {``Autonomous{''} workers include most gig-platform drivers, like those
   working globally for Uber and Lyft, who are usually classified as
   independent contractors and are ineligible for labor protections and
   benefits. The ``new economy{''} and its business model, with its
   fissurization and increased use of contingent and outsourced workers
   hired as independent contractors, provide employers flexibility and
   lower costs by shifting labor costs to the workers. Many of these
   workers operate more as employees rather than genuine independent
   contractors or self-employed entrepreneurs, causing lost employee labor
   benefits and costing the government billions of lost tax dollars. Legal
   attempts continue to classify these workers as employees by means of
   adjudication or legislation interpreting the legal test of ``control{''}
   to have them fit into the traditional employment relationship.
   California recently passed a law using a three-prong test to allow
   drivers who are dependent on a primary hiring company to be presumed as
   employees with full rights and benefits. Still, there are many drivers
   who will be independent contractors. However, the City of Seattle is
   trying an approach different from expanding the ``employee{''}
   definition and has embraced the market practice of the employers' use of
   independent contractors, and has legislatively provided the drivers, as
   independent contractors, with a voice through collective bargaining,
   wherein they could gain labor rights and benefits. Issues of federal
   preemption and antitrust limitations are discussed, and future
   legislation at the state or local level looks possible. The choice
   provided employers is that labor rights are provided to their workers as
   employees or as independent contractors. This Article proposes a model
   of granting labor rights to the ride hailing drivers by legislation at
   the state or local government level that stays under the legal radar of
   federal preemption and meets the requirements of the antitrust law.
   Comparisons will be made with global trends and experiences in the EU
   and in China to place the proposed Seattle model in greater context.
   Selected states in the EU show their bottom line in legal developments
   is to maintain the employer-employee dichotomy, sometimes using the
   ``dependent employee{''} doctrine; whereas, China does not recognize
   ``independent contractors,{''} but allows business contracts for
   services that can provide some advantages.},

Abstract = {Most modern free trade agreements (FTAs) include chapters on a variety
   of topics such as investment, digital trade, labour, gender, environment
   and small-medium enterprises. These new issues are often addressed in
   FTAs as there is a lack of development of multilateral rules on these
   areas at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Further, many of these
   aspects are non-trade issues viz. environment, labour, competition
   policy, and investment. These areas are contentious and often face
   opposition from the Global South and are frequently excluded from the
   scope of dispute settlement. Against this background, this article
   examines the trends with respect to the application of the dispute
   settlement across recent FTAs This article examines recent FTAs and
   categorizes its chapters as follows: (1) Chapters always subject to
   dispute settlement, (2) Chapters not subjected to dispute settlement and
   (3) Chapters that have inconsistent recourse to dispute settlement.
   Accordingly, the article provides a cross country assessment of the FTA
   chapters with dispute settlement provisions and the rationale behind
   such divergent practices.},

Abstract = {In recent years, international insolvency laws have been constantly
   renewed, with two major imbalances: the pressure of legislative
   harmonization and adaptation to national specificities. The tendency to
   harmonize the field of insolvency is the result of both institutional
   cooperation at international or regional level and informal compliance
   pressures from other partner countries.
   A number of international institutions (IMF, World Bank, UNCITRAL,
   European Commission, etc.) have defined recommendations, conventions,
   consultation mechanisms or other cooperation arrangements in recent
   years to establish common practices in insolvency proceedings. These
   institutional mechanisms have directly addressed the field of
   insolvency, but also indirectly, through regulations or related
   agreements, in areas such as competition policy.
   The area where an advanced harmonization exercise has been achieved has
   been the one of cross-border insolvency cooperation. In this case, both
   at the European Union and at the international level, there were
   mandatory and voluntary regulations that strengthened the international
   cooperation platform on insolvency in the light of the company's
   restructuring plan.
   The purpose of our study is to analyze the nature and characteristics of
   the legal status of the insolvency institution in the light of the
   company's restructuring plan.},

Title = {Won't Get Fooled Again: A supervised machine learning approach for
   screening gasoline cartels},
Journal = {ENERGY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We combine supervised machine learning techniques with statistical
   moments of the gasoline price distribution to detect cartels in the
   Brazilian retail market. Standard deviation, coefficient of variation,
   spread, skewness, and kurtosis are predictors that can help identify and
   predict anti-competitive market behavior. We evaluate each classifier
   and discuss the trade-offs related to false-positive (detect cartel when
   it does not exist) and false-negative (do not detect cartel when it does
   exist) predictions. The competition authority needs effective monitoring
   and often anticipating cartel movements. With this in mind, we test the
   algorithms' performance in new datasets (ex-ante screening). Our results
   show that false-negative outcomes can critically increase when the main
   objective is to minimize false-positive predictions. The models' overall
   average scoring rate for testing and predicting cartels in the same city
   is 96.22\%. When we train the algorithms in one city and predict the
   cartel outcomes in other cities, on average, the overall scoring rate is
   equal to 73.75\%. Our work suggests that machine learning classifiers
   have positive attributes and can provide valuable contributions to
   cartels' deterrence. In addition, we offer a policy prescription
   discussion for antitrust authorities regarding the pros and cons of
   proactive tools for inhibiting collusive agreements in retail gasoline
   markets.},

Abstract = {The study of products or business that concurrently serve two or more
   ``sides{''} of consumers has been one of the most active areas of
   microeconomic analysis in the past decade. However, the phrase
   ``two-sided markets{''} has been used to describe markets with a variety
   of economic properties. Different articles and economists use the phrase
   inconsistently. This is probably one of the reasons why the EU antitrust
   authorities have accepted some industries as two-sided markets while not
   others. In order to solve the problem, this paper proposes a definition
   that the term ``two-sided markets{''} should be applied to a product or
   business if, and only if, it is impossible for the business or product
   to exist if it is not operated in a two-sided manner. Importantly, this
   does not include online media. (C) 2015 Jian Li. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {For three decades after liberation in 1949, the Chinese economy
   consisted almost entirely of state monopolies. Economic reforms,
   starting in 1979, sought to increase the efficiency of the economy by
   introducing competitive practices in many sectors of the economy. But
   the Chinese economy has been partially administered by the state for
   over two millennia. As a result, both state-managed and private
   monopolies are still an intrinsic part of the Chinese economy today.
   Despite two decades of anti-monopoly reforms, state-owned enterprises
   (SOEs) continue to dominate key sectors of the economy, particularly in
   resource extraction and financial services. The government is aware of
   the inefficiencies and corruption caused by monopolies, both public and
   private. But Chinese tradition takes a balanced view of social harms and
   weighs the damage caused by monopoly against the stability that SOEs
   have provided China in recent decades. There is less reason for China to
   tolerate private monopolies, but most of them have arisen in conjunction
   with digital technology because of its distinctive cost structure (high
   entry costs, low marginal costs). China has made some use of antitrust
   law, but most economic regulation in China is administrative. Thus the
   anti-monopoly activities that are used to restrain monopoly power in
   China are different from Western practices.},

Title = {The Tethered Economy},
Journal = {GEORGE WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {87},
Number = {4},
Pages = {783-874},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Imagine a future in which every purchase decision is as complex as
   choosing a mobile phone. What will ongoing service cost? Is it
   compatible with other devices you use? Can you move data and
   applications across devices? Can you switch providers? These are just
   some of the questions one must consider when a product is ``tethered{''}
   or persistently linked to the seller. The Internet of Things, but more
   broadly, consumer products with embedded software, are already tethered.
   While tethered products bring the benefits of connection, they also
   carry its pathologies. As sellers blend hardware and software-as well as
   product and service-tethers yoke the consumer to a continuous
   post-transaction relationship with the seller. The consequences of that
   dynamic will be felt both at the level of individual consumer harms and
   on the scale of broader, economy-wide effects. These consumer and
   market-level harms, while distinct, reinforce and amplify one another in
   troubling ways.
   Seller contracts have long sought to shape consumers' legal rights. But
   in a tethered environment, these rights may become nonexistent as legal
   processes are replaced with automated technological enforcement. In such
   an environment, the consumer-seller relationship becomes extractive,
   more akin to consumers captive in an amusement park than to a
   competitive marketplace in which many sellers strive to offer the best
   product for the lowest price.
   At the highest level, consumer protection law is concerned with
   promoting functioning free markets and insulating consumers from harms
   stemming from information asymmetries. We conclude by exploring legal
   options to reduce the pathologies of the tethered economy.},

Abstract = {Construction of production accounting at industrial enterprises in a
   market economy pays close attention, since the amount of profit received
   from final products sale directly depends on proper organization of cost
   accounting and production costs calculation. At the same time, the
   significant part of brewing enterprises profits, however, like other
   enterprises of food industry of the Russian economy, often grows as a
   result of not always an objective increase in selling prices, even when
   antitrust sanctions are imposed. The article presents a fundamentally
   new approach to cost accounting, which fully meets industry specifics
   and peculiarities of breweries technological process.
   In the paper, the authors gave a description of an important area of
   accounting for brewing organizations, such as the system for recording
   production costs and calculating costs of production by trade names of
   products. The article discusses the basics of building cost accounting
   system in detail, providing a procedure for their management. Emphasis
   is placed on key points that determine formation of production costs of
   products (works, services): the manufacturing enterprise specifics, the
   classification of costs.
   It was determined that production enterprise costs should be considered
   for technological operations, and it was also revealed that management
   of brewing products cost price directly depends on the proper
   organization of cost grouping according to calculation items.},

Abstract = {This chapter examines the effect on the market of enforced disclosure of
   private technological information by an antitrust agency, and the role
   played by compatibility choices and the technological gap between
   competing goods in determining market structure. To this end, a
   two-period two-firm model, in which a firm exists as a monopoly in the
   first period, and another firm with a technologically advanced good
   enters in the second period, is applied. On the basis of this modeling
   and a review of case studies, it is concluded that, in situations where
   a monopolistic incumbent wields its private technological information as
   an entry barrier, disclosure of source code to competitors contributes
   to improving social welfare by addressing inefficient allocation of
   resources caused by path dependence. An open source software policy can
   also be justified for getting rid of an entry barrier when technology
   improves gradually.},

Abstract = {The next-generation television (TV) standard will give over-the-air
   (OTA) broadcasters the ability to target advertisements. This could give
   a competi-tive advantage to broadcasters with more channels and hence
   create incentive for consolidation. Consolidation in the OTA TV industry
   could concern policy -makers. We construct a model to estimate revenues
   and costs of targeted adver-tising and derive profit-maximizing
   strategies. We find that profit is maximized by sending targeted
   advertisements via fixed broadband, even on devices that are watched for
   only a few minutes per week, but until costs drop significantly, not via
   mobile broadband in most cases. Our results show that targeted
   advertise-ments would not create strong incentive for consolidation in
   the scenarios that we consider most likely, so policy-makers should be
   sceptical of arguments that consolidation should be allowed on the
   grounds that consolidation leads to large cost savings. However, we do
   identify plausible scenarios where broadcasters with more channels would
   be significantly more profitable.},

Abstract = {The Microsoft v. Motorola cases in U.S. federal court and transformative
   developments in enforcement activity by the European Commission
   antitrust authorities have created a new dynamic intersection between
   competition and intellectual property law. This legal juncture focuses
   on a patent holder's ``reasonable and non-discriminatory,{''} or RAND,
   commitments to standard setting organizations. These organizations play
   a vital role as global platforms for innovation, partnerships, creation
   of efficiencies, and reduction of costs through agreement on standards
   across borders. How courts, scholars, and regulators interpret RAND
   language and enforce the agreements influences the distribution of
   liability between parties, the commercial incentives to develop
   technologies and participate in collaborative standards, and ultimately
   the continued viability of international standard setting regimes. This
   Note analyzes emerging quantitative and qualitative understandings of
   RAND and makes two connected, resulting contentions. First, it argues
   that any legal framework consistent across judicial and regulatory
   spaces must promote a flexible model for licensing negotiation that
   properly considers the incentives of standard essential patent holders
   as it binds them to license at fair rates. Second, it considers
   opportunities for reconciliation between the developing regimes for
   license negotiations in the United States and the European Union and
   asserts that convergence in practice should motivate further evolution
   of this crucial cross-border intersection of market regulation, law, and
   technological innovation.},

Abstract = {Next-generation sequencing broadens the debate about appropriate
   regulatory oversight of genetic testing and may force scholars to move
   beyond familiar privacy and health and safety regulatory issues to
   address new problems with industry structure and economic regulation.
   The genetic testing industry is passing through a period of profound
   structural change in response to shifts in technology and in the legal
   environment. Making genetic testing safe and effective for consumers
   increasingly requires access to comprehensive genomic data
   infrastructures that can support accurate, state-of-the-art
   interpretation of genetic test results. At present, there are
   significant barriers to access and there is no sector-specific regulator
   with power to ensure appropriate data access. Without it, genetic
   testing will not be safe for consumers even when it is performed at
   CLIA-certified laboratories using tests that have been FDA-cleared or
   approved. This article explores the emerging structure of the genetic
   testing industry and describes its present economic regulatory vacuum.
   In view of this gap in regulation, the article explores whether
   generally applicable law, particularly antitrust law, may offer
   solutions to the industry's data access problems. It concludes that
   courts may have a useful role to play, particularly in Europe and other
   jurisdictions where the essential facilities doctrine enjoys continued
   vitality. After Verizon Communications v. Law Offices of Curtis V.
   Trinko, the role of U.S. federal courts is less certain. Congress has
   demonstrated willingness to address access issues as they emerged in
   other infrastructure industries in recent decades. This article
   expresses no preference between legislative and judicial solutions. Its
   aim is simply to highlight an emerging economic regulatory issue which,
   if left unresolved, presents real health and safety concerns for
   consumers who receive genetic tests.},

Abstract = {This research provides a new perspective to investigate the broadband
   diffusion in eight states of the U.S. by studying the two-stage entry
   decisions, namely, upgrading and subsequent product decisions, by the
   cable television system operators, one of the early dominant players in
   the broadband market, and examines the role of competition, market
   characteristics and firm heterogeneity in the cable company's decisions
   in a dynamic setting. Comparing the empirical results of the decision
   models of both stages can give new insights into the dynamics of
   broadband diffusion. The empirical results show that the subsequent
   product decision is affected more by the demand determinants, while the
   upgrading decision is affected more by the cost determinants. The
   results also indicate that policies which aim to reduce the entry cost
   such as a low city fee can largely encourage firms to upgrade the
   network, while subsequent policies that help boost the demand can help
   firms diversify into new digital services early. The effectiveness of
   competition policy in the broadband diffusion is confirmed in both
   stages. Strategic responses by cable firms to the presence of RBOCs are
   more noticeable in the second-staged product decision than in the
   first-staged upgrading decision. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Broadly speaking, a two-sided market is one in which 1) two sets of
   agents interact through an intermediary or platform, and 2) the
   decisions of each set of agents affects the outcomes of the other set of
   agents, typically through an externality. In the case of a video game
   system, for instance PlayStation, the intermediary is the console
   producer - Sony - while the two sets of agents are consumers and video
   game developers. Neither consumers nor game developers will be
   interested in the PlayStation if the other party is not. Similarly, a
   successful payment card requires both consumer usage and merchant
   acceptance, where both consumers and merchants value each others'
   participation. Many more products fit into this paradigm, such as search
   engines, newspapers, and almost any advertiser-supported media (examples
   in which consumers typically negatively value, rather than positively
   value, the participation of the other side), as well as most software or
   title-based operating systems and consumer electronics. This paper seeks
   to explain what two-sided markets are and why they interest economists.
   I discuss the strategies that firms typically consider, and I highlight
   a number of puzzling outcomes from the perspective of the economics of
   two-sided markets. Finally, I consider the implications for public
   policy, particularly antitrust and regulatory policy, where there have
   been a number of recent issues involving media, computer operating
   systems, and payment cards.},

Abstract = {This article conducts a detailed analysis of the concept of economic
   dependence and exploitative abuse based on how their treatment in
   competition law and economics and their enforcement in European case law
   have evolved. Although the theoretical roots of these concepts lie in
   economic theory, these issues have been ignored or considered only
   scantily in the context of competition law enforcement. An effects-based
   approach should take these problems into account and could provide
   insights into how to portray the impacts of these abuses. We draw on two
   examples - from the agri-food industries and the digital economy - of
   relevant economic dependence issues. This paper highlights the existence
   of a paradox: although industrial organization models provide relevant
   tools to characterize these abuses, assess their effects, and devise
   remedies, it seems that they are seldom used by competition law
   enforcers.},

Journal = {UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW},

Pages = {1775-1810},
Abstract = {The development of self-learning and independent computers has long
   captured our imagination. The HAL 9000 computer, in the 1968 film, 2001:
   A Space Odyssey, for example, assured, ``I am putting myself to the
   fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can
   ever hope to do.{''} Machine learning raises many challenging legal and
   ethical questions as to the relationship between man and machine,
   humans' control or lack of it over machines, and accountability for
   machine activities.
   While these issues have long captivated our interest, few would envision
   the day when these developments (and the legal and ethical challenges
   raised by them) would become an antitrust issue. Sophisticated computers
   are central to the competitiveness of present and future markets. With
   the accelerating development of AI, they are set to change the
   competitive landscape and the nature of competitive restraints. As
   pricing mechanisms shift to computer pricing algorithms, so too will the
   types of collusion. We are shifting from the world where executives
   expressly collude in smoke-filled hotel rooms to a world where pricing
   algorithms continually monitor and adjust to each other's prices and
   market data.
   Our paper addresses these developments and considers the application of
   competition law to an advanced ``computerised trade environment.{''}
   After discussing the way in which computerised technology is changing
   the competitive landscape, we explore four scenarios where AI can foster
   anticompetitive collusion and the legal and ethical challenges each
   scenario raises.},

Abstract = {The article is devoted to the research and development of a diagnostic
   system for detecting signs of cooperative pricing in retail markets. We
   consider methods and algorithms for successively identifying the
   presence of market power, as well as signs of abuse of this power. Five
   components of the diagnostic system are distinguished: dominance,
   concentration based on market shares, concentration based on market
   prices, general cooperation and episodic (or seasonal) cooperation. As a
   basic concept for the detecting of cooperative behavior, we used
   conjectural variations approach. In our opinion, it uses a relatively
   small number of a priori assumptions about interactions between market
   agents, which is important for empirical research. Mathematical models
   are considered for calculating the level of cooperation, allowing to
   analyze the degree of use of market power in a static and dynamic
   aspects. The proposed diagnostic system can be used by government,
   antitrust and regulatory authorities to monitor the level of competition
   in retail markets and identify signs of price cooperation. In turn, the
   same methods can also help market agents to analyze their pricing
   policy, to prove the fact of fair competitive behavior and to adjust
   pricing in a timely manner.},

Abstract = {We identify a competition-policy-based argument for regulating the
   secondary features of complex or complexly priced products when
   consumers have limited attention. Limited attention implies that
   consumers can only ``study{''} a small number of complex products in
   full, while-by failing to check secondary features-they can
   superficially ``browse{''} more. Interventions limiting ex post consumer
   harm through safety regulations, caps on certain fees, or other methods
   induce consumers to do more or more meaningful browsing, enhancing
   competition. We show that for a pro-competitive effect to obtain, the
   regulation must apply to the secondary features, and not to the total
   price or value of the product. As an auxiliary positive prediction, we
   establish that because low-value consumers are often more likely to
   study-and therefore less likely to browse-than high-value consumers, the
   average price consumers pay can be increasing in the share of low-value
   consumers. We discuss applications of our insights to health-insurance
   choice, the European Union's principle on unfair contract terms, food
   safety in developing countries, and the shopping behaviour of (and
   prices paid by) low-income and high-income consumers.},

Abstract = {Historically, electronic communications networks were built to support
   specific services. For example, fixed and mobile telephone networks were
   developed to support voice telephone calls, whereas cable networks,
   satellites, and over-the-air broadcasts were built to support television
   services (unidirectional linear video). However, these communications
   networks are currently incorporating new technology and are rapidly
   evolving into multiservice networks that support voice, video, and data
   over a single, fully integrated communications platform. NGNs provide to
   customer access to a large range of services, leading to the increase of
   the bandwidth demand -For example, if customers encounter their demand
   on a single network, a triple play product, the bandwidth demand for
   that network will increase. Moreover, the migration to NGN may require
   upgrades to the infrastructure to provide sufficient service quality.
   The entry of new competitors can be based on the resale of services from
   the incumbent, on building up their own infrastructures, on renting
   unbundled infrastructure from incumbents, or, on the combination of the
   above elements. The availability of these options to competitors and
   price definition are generally determined by regulatory policies. So,
   the introduction of NGNs by telecommunication network operators
   obligates the national regulators adapt their access regulation regimes
   to the new technological conditions. Regulation and/or promotion of
   competition by regulatory measures need to be analyzed and compared. So,
   in this paper we explore the role of competition policy and regulation.},

Abstract = {Extreme value theory can analyze the extreme changes of financial market
   returns, and it is an effective financial risk management model. The
   distribution characteristics of financial assets' returns are the core
   content of all financial models. The assumptions about the fluctuation
   behavior of returns and its distribution characteristics are of great
   theoretical and practical significance for the measurement and
   management of financial risks. We compare the estimates of value at risk
   by the peak over threshold model with that by the traditional
   variance-covariance method. During downturns, the peak over threshold
   model based value at risk estimates is higher relative to that by the
   traditional variance-covariance approach. At the same time, this paper
   conducts statistical analysis of basic data through data collection and
   combines the establishment of statistical methods to study the practical
   effects of various factors on carbon productivity in China. In addition,
   this paper constructs a low-carbon economic neural network model based
   on particle swarm optimization to study carbon emissions. Finally, on
   the basis of analysis and research, this paper puts forward policy
   recommendations for China's future low-carbon development model, and
   then provides reference for guiding the development of China's future
   low-carbon model and provides theoretical basis for subsequent related
   research.},

Abstract = {Competition policy has been on the top of the European Community's
   political agenda since the construction of a European Common Market in
   the 1960s. A comprehensive body of law was created to eliminate market
   dominance, cartels or state aid and to control mergers and competition.
   A key issue of the EC competition law was the Council Regulation 17/62,
   which established the idea of `openness' of competition in European
   market law for the decades to come. Infrastructure sectors like
   telecommunications were, however, mostly excluded from the Council
   Regulation 17/62 in the early 1960s. The European Commission put the
   question of an application of EC competition law again on the political
   agenda in the 1980s. Dramatic losses of European producers of
   telecommunication technology in the share on global markets further
   backed the Commission, which in 1987 issued a first green paper on
   telecommunications. This paper had an enormous effect on the
   liberalisation of the telecommunication sector across Europe and
   subsequently incorporated the sector into the scope of application of EC
   competition law. The Council Regulations 17/62's idea of `openness' and
   `open networks' were established as basic principles for European
   telecommunication markets with three decades' delay and made Europe
   ready for digital technologies and in particular for the internet. The
   paper analyses the discourses and imaginaries of `open networks' in the
   debate about the relationship between EC competition law and the
   telecommunication sector in a long term perspective from the 1960 to the
   1980s.},

Journal = {DUKE LAW JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Many Internet-access providers simultaneously offer Internet access and
   other services, such as traditional video channels, video on demand,
   voice calling, and other emerging services, through a single, converged
   platform. These other services which can be called ``managed
   services{''} because the carrier offers them only to its subscribers in
   a manner designed to ensure some quality of service in many
   circumstances will compete with services that are offered by
   unaffiliated parties as applications or services on the Internet. This
   situation creates an important interaction effect between the domains of
   Internet access and managed services, an effect that has largely been
   missing from the decade-long debate over network neutrality rules for
   Internet service. This Article examines this interaction effect,
   focusing on the context of online video services and on the recent
   NBC-Comcast transaction that finally highlighted these concerns. The
   Article contends that, when these interaction effects are understood, a
   nondiscrimination rule applied only to a converged carrier's Internet
   service can be rendered ineffective by the carrier's move to managed
   services offerings. As a result, a nondiscrimination rule, if it is to
   be effective, would need to be supplemented by specific behavioral or
   structural rules that both require the carrier to maintain its Internet
   service and limit the carrier's freedom of action in the managed
   services domain. This reveals the difficulty of drafting effective
   nondiscrimination rules. It also reveals that noneconomic justifications
   for nondiscrimination rules cannot stand alone; they must be
   supplemented by the economic-reasoning tools common to antitrust
   argument, in order to identify and determine the ultimate effects of the
   rules.},

Abstract = {Machine learning is transforming the economy, reshaping operations in
   communications, law enforcement, and medicine, among other sectors. But
   all is not well: Many machine-learning-based applications harvest vast
   amounts of personal information and yield results that are
   systematically biased. In response, policy makers have begun to offer a
   range of incomplete solutions. In so doing, they have overlooked the
   possibility-suggested intuitively by scholars across disciplines-that
   these systems are natural monopolies and have thus neglected the long
   legal tradition of natural monopoly regulation.
   Drawing on the computer science, economics, and legal literatures, I
   find that some machine-learning-based applications may be natural
   monopolies, particularly where the fixed costs of developing these
   applications and the computational costs of optimizing these systems are
   especially high, and where network effects are especially strong. This
   conclusion yields concrete policy implications: Where natural monopolies
   exist, public oversight and regulation are typically superior to market
   discipline through competition. Hence, where machine-learning-based
   applications are natural monopolies, this regulatory tradition offers
   one framework for confronting a range of issues-from privacy to accuracy
   and bias-that attend to such systems. Just as prior natural
   monopolies-the railways, electric grids, and telephone networks- faced
   rate and service regulation to protect against extractive,
   anticompetitive, and undemocratic behaviors, so too might
   machine-learning-based applications face similar public regulation to
   limit intrusive data collection and protect against algorithmic
   redlining, among other harms.},

Abstract = {Data-driven technologies provide businesses with ever stronger abilities
   to engage in behavioural manipulation, steer consumer preferences, and
   exploit individual vulnerabilities. The article argues that competition
   law needs to give more prominence to consumer sovereignty and consumers'
   freedom of choice in response to the rise in personalized forms of
   consumer exploitation by dominant firms, whose harm goes beyond the
   scope of the remedies offered by data protection and consumer law.
   Analysing the scope to establish exploitative abuses under Article 102
   TFEU, the article discusses how personalization challenges current
   competition concepts, and submits that competition analysis needs to be
   adapted at the stage of assessing abuse to address competitive harm from
   personalization. The article proposes recognizing ``personalized
   exploitation{''} as abuse of dominance by incorporating dynamic consumer
   vulnerabilities into the competition analysis and by assessing
   anticompetitive effects against a ``personalized welfare standard{''} of
   those exploited instead of against the overall consumer welfare.},

Title = {Estimating Discrete Joint Probability Distributions for Demographic
   Characteristics at the Store Level Given Store Level Marginal
   Distributions and a City-Wide Joint Distribution},

Abstract = {This paper provides a solution to the problem of estimating a joint
   distribution using the associated marginal distributions and a related
   joint distribution. The particular application we have in mind is
   estimating joint distributions of demographic characteristics
   corresponding to market areas for individual retail stores. Marginal
   distributions are generally available at the census tract level, but
   joint distributions are only available for Metropolitan Statistical
   Areas which are generally much larger than the market for a single
   retail store. Joint distributions over demographics are an important
   input into mixed logit demand models for aggregate data. Market shares
   that vary systematically with demographics are essential for relieving
   the restrictions imposed by the Independence from Irrelevant Alternative
   property of the logit model.
   We approach this problem by formulating a parametric function that
   incorporates both the city-wide joint distributional information and
   marginal information specific to the retail store's market area. To
   estimate the function, we form moment conditions equating the moments of
   the parametric function to observed data, and we input these into a GMM
   objective.
   In one of our illustrations we use four marginal demographic
   distributions from each of eight stores in Dominick's Finer Foods data
   archive to estimate a four dimensional joint distribution for each
   store. Our results show that our GMMapproach produces estimated joint
   distributions that differ substantially from the product of marginal
   distributions and emit marginals that closely match the observed
   marginal distributions. Mixed logit demand estimates are also presented
   which show the estimates to be sensitive to the formulation of the
   demographics distribution.},

Abstract = {How can executives develop their skills as strategists? One good way is
   to learn from the masters. In a recent book, Strategy Rules: Five
   Timeless Lessons From Bill Gates, Andy Grove, and Steve Jobs
   (HarperCollins, 2015), David B. Yoffie and Michael A. Cusumano examine
   strategy lessons from the careers of the iconic CEOs of Microsoft Corp.,
   Intel Corp., and Apple Inc. MIT Sloan Management Review editorial
   director Martha E. Mangelsdorf interviewed Yoffie and Cusumano to
   discuss how Gates, Grove, and Jobs approached strategy While Yoffie and
   Cusumano observed that each of the three executives began with their own
   skills and capabilities, they were all able to learn and grow.
   In the interview, Yoffie and Cusumano discussed the five important
   strategy lessons they drew from studying Gates, Grove, and Jobs.
   1. Look forward, reason back. While it's natural for managers who are
   figuring out what to do to look backward and reason forward, this
   approach may be less effective than the reverse. Like chess players,
   Yoffie explained, strategists ``need to think several steps ahead
   towards the end of the game and then reason back to what that means
   about what they need to do today{''} Gates, for example, realized that
   computers would become commodities and that value would reside in the
   software.
   2. Make big bets, without betting the company. One of Microsoft's
   biggest bets, noted Cusumano, was its 1991 decision to break with IBM.
   It was ``a huge gamble,{''} he said, but by that time Microsoft had lots
   of other customers.
   3. Build platforms and ecosystems, not just products. Cusumano observed
   that all three of the CEOs learned that platforms had more strategic
   power than products. ``I can't think of any three CEOs who have
   clarified our thinking more on that enormously important strategic
   concept,{''} Cusumano said.
   4. Exploit leverage and power play both judo and sumo. Yoffie pointed
   out that great strategists need to be both clever and tough. Clever
   means ``trying to find ways to take advantage of your competitors'
   strengths and turn them to your advantage,{''} he explained. But in
   addition, ``you have to be tough enough to extract as much value as
   possible in your interactions with other businesses,{''} without
   triggering antitrust problems.
   5. Shape the organization around your personal anchor. ``You want to
   dive deep into the things you're really good at, but at the same time
   stay at a high level and always keep the big picture in mind,{''} Yoffie
   said. ``You have to know yourself, know what you're good at, and know

Abstract = {Since the seminal paper of Rochet and the Nobel Prize laureate Tirole in
   2003, the theory of multisided markets has garnered considerable
   academic attention. The practical application of the theory remains,
   however, challenging. This article seeks to bring together the key
   features of multisided market economics and identify the key principles,
   which can affect practical enforcement. Following a consideration of the
   economic and legal challenges involved in the analysis of multisided
   platforms, the article reviews two case studies-the European Court of
   Justice's recent MasterCard decision concerning multilateral interchange
   fees and the Dutch Competition Authority's review of the European
   Directories-Truvo Nederland merger-and showcases the associated
   enforcement challenges.},

Title = {DURBIN'S FOLLY: THE ERRATIC COURSE OF DEBIT CARD MARKETS?},
Journal = {COMPETITION POLICY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {58-73},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {The passage of the Durbin Amendment in July, 2010 followed extensive
   claims by Senator Durbin and retailers that the only consequence of the
   law would be to bleed out the excessive debit interchange charges that
   platform operators and issuing banks collected from retailers. In their
   view, the proper source of revenues was from debit card holders
   themselves, as in the Canadian system. Events have not played out that
   way. After the Federal Reserve authorized a \$0.21 base interchange fee,
   which was generous given the narrow statutory language, the major banks
   found it impossible to raise rates in the face of sustained political
   and market pressure, goaded on in part by Senator Durbin himself. At the
   same time, there is no evidence that the reduction in debit card fees
   have been passed through by merchants to their customers.
   The reason this adventure into regulation has failed is that Senator
   Durbin and his allies did not understand the operation of the
   fast-moving two-sided debit card market. In their view, platform
   operators like Visa and MasterCard operated a duopoly that afforded them
   the market power to extract rents from merchants while feeding oversized
   fees to issuing banks in order to attract new streams of customers. That
   analysis ignores two brute facts. First, the only contest between
   platform operators, banks and merchants is over the considerable surplus
   generated by a debit card interchange system. Those fees are constrained
   because merchants always have the option to pull out of the system if
   interchange rates are set too high. Second, the interchange fees paid to
   the issuing banks are not just kept in a vault, but are spent in
   maintaining the fixed costs of running the system and recruiting new
   customers, so that all rents are dissipated by these competitive forces.
   There is, therefore, no unearned surplus, and issuing banks are now
   forced to adopt inefficient systems of fee collection to offset the
   nearly \$8 billion in lost interchange fees.
   Full awareness of the competitive nature of the debit interchange market
   should have led the courts to declare the current regulatory system a
   confiscatory form of ratemaking. The combination of higher
   administrative fees under the Durbin Amendment and lower returns
   necessarily pushes banks below a competitive rate of return on key debit
   card services, especially since subsequent events have made clear that
   there will be zero recoupment in revenues from charges to debit card
   holders. The level of confiscation is still greater because smaller
   banks-those with under \$10 billion in assets-may continue to collect
   their full interchange fees in ways that tilt the market even further.
   Nonetheless, by adopting an all-too-forgiving rational basis test, the
   courts sustained the statute by showing excessive deference to Congress.
   Given the situation today, tinkering will not fix the inherent
   structural defects of the Durbin Amendment, which should be repealed
   forthwith before it does any greater damage to debit card transactions.},

Abstract = {This research examines drivers of consumer word of mouth (WOM) in
   free-product settings, revealing fundamental differences with
   traditional, paid-product settings. The authors build and investigate a
   theoretical model that highlights two unique characteristics of free
   products (reciprocity motivation and diminished adoption risk) and
   considers their implications for WOM sharing. Results of a retrospective
   survey, two controlled experiments, and an analysis of more than 5,000
   mobile apps at Google Play and Apple's App Store reveal that consumers
   are generally more likely to share their opinions of free products than
   paid products, because of feelings of reciprocity toward the producer.
   However, this difference is reduced when prior consumer WOM is low in
   volume and highly disperse, signaling greater adoption risk. These
   findings contribute to nascent understanding of free-product marketing
   while offering new insights for catalyzing consumer WOM.},

Abstract = {Modern mobile commerce enterprises of any format and dimension, due to
   their flexibility and technological efficiency, are able to adapt to the
   changing environmental conditions and form new areas of activity in
   accordance with the challenges of the time. Mobile commerce is a
   continuation of e-commerce, the transfer of e-commerce into the most
   diverse mobile forms. Forms of the implementation of mobile commerce and
   its innovative mobile communication technologies allow you to transfer
   the information flow to the most advanced mobile gadgets of users,
   giving them complete freedom in their movements in space. The article
   discusses the objects of mobile commerce, provides a classification and
   analysis of market activities of subjects of mobile commerce. National
   peculiarities of entrepreneurship in the mobile commerce market of
   Russia are revealed. The quartet of the largest federal players in a
   completely mature mobile commerce market created a unique situation of
   the classical oligopoly in the face of imperfect competition, which put
   the domestic antitrust authority in a difficult position. Although the
   appearance of reliable competition requires a reduction in the financial
   success of each member of this strategic group, a kind of quadriga, in
   particular a decrease in marginal service revenue, a decrease in the
   growth rate of net profit, the reality of cartel conspiracy, especially
   in terms of price and tariff formation for a range of services mobile
   communications, of harmonization of nonprice instruments, more and more
   becomes convex and tangible. And the extremely high indicators and
   characteristics of market concentration and tension for the oligopoly
   structure of mobile operators can become the source material of the case
   study for analysts of the territorial administrations of the FAS RF.
   While working on a report for the IBIMA Conference, the authors pay
   special attention to the construction and testing of a statistical model
   for analyzing the revenue from advertising activity of oligopolistic
   quartet participants in the mobile communications market.},

Title = {BEYOND FAIR USE},
Journal = {CORNELL LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {96},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-137},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {For centuries, the fair use doctrine has been the main if not the
   exclusive bastion of user rights. Originating in the English courts of
   equity, the doctrine permitted users, under appropriate circumstances,
   to employ copyrighted content without the rightsholder's consent. In the
   current digital media environment, however, the uncertainty that shrouds
   fair use and the proliferation of technological protection measures
   undermine the doctrine and its role in copyright policy. Notably, the
   enactment of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which prohibits the
   circumvention of technological protection measures even for fair use
   purposes, has diminished the ability of fair use to counterbalance a
   copyright owner's rights in the digital age.
   Recognizing the relatively precarious state of the fair use doctrine,
   many copyright scholars have rushed to resuscitate the doctrine,
   offering various ways to revamp fair use. As this Article makes clear,
   these proposals fall short of the mark. To address the shortcomings of
   the fair use doctrine in the digital age, this Article reconceives the
   policy challenge and takes a fundamentally different tack. Rather than
   tinkering with the fair use doctrine, this Article proposes the creation
   of a system of new user-privileges that would supplement fair use.
   Specifically, this Article crafts a framework of adaptive regulation
   that would cause copyright owners to dramatically increase the access
   and use opportunities granted to users. The framework would achieve this
   goal by requiring content owners and distributors to acknowledge user
   needs and even compete among themselves over the creation of new
   user-liberties. Such an approach, this Article explains, is superior to
   rival suggestions and can best assure ongoing technological development
   and the preservation of user privileges in the digital age.},

Abstract = {The common idea of open access policy is that it refers to the sharing
   of particular elements, such as wholesale access networks, backhaul,
   under-sea cable and internet exchange points in fixed and mobile
   networks. In broadband networks, the use of open access policy usually
   refers to the infrastructure parts, which are considered a bottleneck.
   Many regulators have generally focused open access policy on fixed
   broadband networks, especially digital subscriber line (DSL) technology,
   in the last decade. Local loop unbundling (LW) regulation is one of the
   main strategies for the regulator to open access to an incumbent's
   bottleneck network in order to soften its monopoly power and encourage
   competition in the DSL broadband market. The OECD countries have
   different strategies regarding unbundling local loop and infrastructure
   competition, as the characteristics and infrastructure networks of
   countries vary. There are currently more choices of next generation
   network (NGN) technologies to develop. While local loop unbundling may
   not be applied fully to NGN development (the cost is not sunk, more
   technologies are available to implement, incentive of investment by
   operator), it can indicate benefits and drawbacks of open access policy
   in the past decade that can be adapted to NGN.
   The empirical results of this study show that during 2002-2008, LLU
   regulation was one of the strategies used to increase broadband adoption
   in countries that had difficulty encouraging infrastructure competition.
   Unbundling regulation can therefore be implemented carefully and
   differently in each country that has inefficiency that is harmful to
   consumers in its market from a monopoly incumbent. Infrastructure
   competition, on the other hand, is introduced as another strategy to
   increase broadband adoption. The empirical results of this study
   indicate that infrastructure competition can be used as a strategy when
   there are already enough infrastructures in the area or country. These
   results support the idea of using open access and infrastructure
   competition policy depending on the existing competition of broadband
   infrastructure in each country. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {In selection markets, where the cost of serving consumers is
   heterogeneous and noncontractible, nonprice product features allow a
   firm to sort profitable from unprofitable consumers. An example of this
   ``sorting by quality'' is the use of down payments to dissuade borrowers
   who are unlikely to repay. We study a model in which consumers have
   multidimensional types and a firm offers a single product of endogenous
   quality, as in Spence (1975). These two ingredients generate a novel
   sorting incentive in a firm's first-order condition for quality, which
   is a simple ratio. The denominator is marginal consumer surplus, a
   measure of market power. The numerator is the covariance, among marginal
   consumers, between marginal willingness to pay for quality and cost to
   the firm. We provide conditions under which this term is signed and
   contrast the sorting incentives of a profit-maximizer and a social
   planner. We then use this characterization to quantify the importance of
   sorting empirically in subprime auto lending, analytically sign its
   impact in a model of add-on pricing, and calibrate optimal competition
   policy in health insurance markets.},

Abstract = {Transportation Network Companies offer notable service advances-but do
   they comply with the law? I offer evidence of some important shortfalls,
   then consider how the legal system might appropriately respond. Though
   it is tempting to forgive many violations in light of the companies'
   benefits, I offer a cautionary assessment. For one, I note the
   incentives that might result, including a race-to-the-bottom as a series
   of companies forego all manner of requirements. Furthermore, the firms
   that best compete in such an environment are likely to be those that
   build a corporate culture of ignoring laws, a diagnosis that finds
   support in numerous controversial Uber practices. On the whole, I
   suggest evenhanded enforcement of applicable laws, with thoughtful
   changes implemented with appropriate formality, but no automatic free
   pass for the platforms that have recently framed laws and regulations as
   suggestions rather than requirements.},

Abstract = {Online behavioural advertising (OBA) relies on inferential analytics to
   target consumers based on data about their online behaviour. While the
   technology can improve the matching of adverts with consumers'
   preferences, it also poses risks to consumer welfare as consumers face
   offer discrimination and the exploitation of their cognitive errors. The
   technology's risks are exacerbated by the market power of ad
   intermediaries. This article shows how the Unfair Commercial Practices
   Directive (UCPD) can protect consumers from behavioural exploitation by
   incorporating market power analysis. Drawing on current research in
   economic theory, it argues for applying a stricter average consumer test
   if the market for ad intermediaries is highly concentrated. This
   stricter test should neutralize negative effects of behavioural
   targeting on consumer welfare. The article shows how OBA can amount to a
   misleading action and/or a misleading omission under Articles 6 and 7
   UCPD, as well as an aggressive practice under Article 8 UCPD. It further
   considers how the recent legislative proposals by the European
   Commission to enact a Digital Markets Act (DMA) and a Digital Services
   Act (DSA) may interact with the UCPD and the suggested stricter average
   consumer test.},

Abstract = {Competition law is generally focused on competition in a market. Yet, as
   recent economic studies have clearly indicated, one of the main sources
   of competition concerns of jurisdictions around the world is the impact
   of high levels of aggregate concentration in their markets, when a small
   group of economic entities controls a large part of the economic
   activity through holdings in many markets. High levels of aggregate
   concentration can significantly impact competition and welfare. On the
   one hand, conglomerates' substantial resources and varied experiences,
   as well as their economies of scale and scope, often enable them to
   enter markets more readily than other firms, especially when entry
   barriers are high. On the other hand, high levels of aggregate
   concentration raise significant competitive concerns. Most importantly,
   oligopolistic coordination in and across markets as well as entry
   barriers into markets might be increased. These effects, in turn, might
   lead to stagnation and poor utilization of resources, which adversely
   affect growth and welfare. Another major concern is a political economy
   one: given their size and economic heft, large conglomerates may attempt
   to translate their economic power into political power in order to
   create, protect and entrench their privileged positions. Given these
   effects, the article attempts to explore the weight given-if at all-to
   aggregate concentration in the application of competition laws around
   the world. The analysis is based, inter alia, on the experiences of 35
   different jurisdictions in dealing with aggregate concentration through
   competition law, based on a survey performed with the assistance of the
   UN Conference on Trade and Development.},

Abstract = {Digital markets offer abundant free content but exhibit extreme
   concentration among content aggregation intermediaries. These
   characteristics are linked. Weak copyright environments select against
   stand-alone content-delivery structures and select for bundled
   aggregation structures in which free content for users promotes
   positively priced advertising and data-collection services for firms.
   Dominant intermediaries promote commoditization, and the reallocation of
   market rents from content producers to content aggregators, through
   litigation and free content distribution that weaken copyright
   protections. The potential net welfare effects raise concern. Network
   effects, compounded by weak inventory constraints, scale economies, and
   learning effects, promote winner-takes-all outcomes in the intermediary
   services market while weak copyright may generate output distortions in
   the content production market.},

Abstract = {Competition concerns arising from the seeking of injunctions by
   FRAND-encumbered (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) standard
   essential patent (SEP) owners have become a contentious issue. This
   issue has attracted the attention of many competition enforcement
   authorities and no consensus is reached as to the compatibility of such
   injunctive relief with competition law. This is also a hard and
   challenging problem faced by China. A coherent and balanced response is
   urgently needed under current China's legal framework. Therefore, this
   article proposes that a basic regulating approach should be established
   first to treat the seeking of injunctions by FRAND-encumbered SEP owners
   as an independent anti-competitive practice prohibited by the
   Anti-monopoly Law. Then, an analysis framework should be established to
   consider the circumstances in which and the extent to which such seeking
   of injunctions should be limited from the perspective of competition
   enforcement. The behaviour of both SEP owners and SEP users should be
   properly examined.},

Abstract = {Using an exhaustive database of bookings in one large chain of hotels
   active in Oslo (2013-2016), we estimate a nested-logit demand model that
   allows us to evaluate substitution patterns between online distribution

Title = {HARMONIZATION OF ECONOMIC AND LEGAL MECHANISMS FOR DEEPENING
   EU-UKRAINIAN RELATIONS},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {174-181},
Abstract = {The policy of Ukraine for the establishment and development of relations
   with the European Union began in 1993, was carried out all the years of
   Ukraine's existence, and received intensive deepening with the beginning
   of the formation of an international treaty - the Association Agreement,
   which includes a list of legal, social, economic, and technical
   regulations, and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), in 2014
   and its final signing in 2017. Political and economic objectives of the
   Agreement are of fundamental importance to the future of both Ukraine
   and the whole European region. The political goal is to implement
   European standards on the territory of Ukraine. This implies the
   introduction of fundamental European values, namely democracy, rule of
   law, respect for human rights and the standards of the European security
   system. The Agreement does not foresee membership in the European Union,
   however, does not exclude such an opportunity in the future. The
   economic goal is to help to modernize the Ukrainian economy by expanding
   trade volumes with the EU and other countries, as well as reforming
   economic regulation mechanisms in line with the best European practices.
   Subject to the improvement of the business climate, Ukraine will become
   attractive for foreign and domestic investment for further production
   for export to the EU and other markets of the world. Harmonization of
   standards and European regulations has become a much more important
   process than the fulfilment of strictly technical requirements and
   underlies the introduction of effective governance without corruption.
   In the process of harmonization of interaction, an adaptive
   institutional mechanism was formed (the highest level - annual Summits;
   the key coordinator is the Association Council, consisting of members of
   the Council of the European Union and members of the European
   Commission, and members of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine; the
   level of operational coordination - the Association Parliamentary
   Committee, which includes members of the European Parliament,
   representatives of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, and the Civil Society
   Platform; in order to coordinate processes on the territory of Ukraine,
   the Ukrainian government has introduced a few supervisory committees and
   commissions). The harmonization of the economic aspect of the mechanism
   has been determined in solving issues of openness of markets for
   duty-free import from Ukraine in April 2014, obtaining a visa-free
   regime with the EU, abolishing export-import tariffs, implementing
   European technical standards for food safety, phytosanitary norms,
   competition policy, service provision, and public procurement policy.
   The issues of further deepening of relations include a review of the
   terms for the introduction of regulations and legislative provisions
   before their actual implementation, stabilization of financial and
   economic processes in the country, and further development of democratic
   values and social institutions.},

Abstract = {Since the failure of the Havana Charter in 1950, it has not been
   possible to agree upon a binding competition law at the global level.
   However, following the fiasco of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
   Ministerial Conference in Cancun in 2003, the number of bilateral and
   regional trade agreements containing competition law chapters, or at
   least competition-related rules, has increased noteworthy. This reflects
   that trade and competition are closely intertwined. In an ever more
   integrated, globalized, and digitized economy, the competition law
   framework needs to be internationalized. If a binding competition law is
   not possible at the global level, it is only logical that bilateral and
   regional trade agreements fill the gap. This article questions the
   extent to which these agreements contribute to the convergence of
   competition law. In this context, the development in Northeast Asia
   seems promising and may provide a guidepost for establishing
   international standards of competition law cooperation and enforcement.
   Presented here is the idea of localized harmonization, which takes
   advantage of closer affinity between bilateral and regional partners.
   With a sufficient degree of convergence, it is not excluded that efforts
   towards a multilateral competition agreement could be relaunched one
   day.},

Abstract = {The notion of `markets' occupies a prominent yet ambiguous position in
   copyright discourse. When the term is raised, the copyright owner's
   market tends to be taken as its implicit meaning, perpetuating an
   assumption that the market needs to be protected solely to preserve
   incentives to create. This dominant narrative overshadows an important
   dimension of copyright markets - disseminative competition, which is
   characterised by rival disseminators competing for inputs (copyright
   content) and audiences (copyright consumers). With the aid of
   competition law principles, this article distinguishes competition for
   dissemination of content from competition for the creation of content.
   It underscores the importance of dissemination markets to a
   well-functioning copyright system and shows how certain copyright
   doctrines substantively impact on disseminative competition. In
   reframing contemporary understandings of copyright markets, this article
   highlights the biases in copyright infringement analysis that may favour
   incumbent content disseminators to the detriment of a vibrant and
   innovative digital economy.},

Abstract = {Cyberattacks are inevitable and widespread. Existing scholarship on
   cyberespionage and cyberwar is undermined by its futile obsession with
   preventing attacks. This Article draws on research in normal accident
   theory and complex system design to argue that successful attacks are
   unavoidable. Cybersecurity must focus on mitigating breaches rather than
   preventing them. First, this Article analyzes cybersecurity's market
   failures and information asymmetries. It argues that these economic and
   structural factors necessitate greater regulation, particularly given
   the abject failures of alternative approaches. Second, this Article
   divides cyberthreats into two categories: known and unknown. To reduce
   the impact of known threats with identified fixes, the federal
   government should combine funding and legal mandates to push firms to
   redesign their computer systems. Redesign should follow two principles:
   disaggregation dispersing data across many locations and heterogeneity
   running those disaggregated components on variegated software and
   hardware. For unknown threats ``zero-day attacks{''} regulation should
   seek to increase the government's access to markets for these exploits.
   Regulation cannot exorcise the ghost in the network, but it can contain
   the damage it causes.
   Maekum produced a white lump of foam slightly smaller than Case's head,
   fished a pearl-handled switchblade on a green nylon lanyard out of the
   hip pocket of his tattered shorts, and carefully slit the plastic. He
   extracted a rectangular object and passed it to Case. ``Thas part some
   gun, mon?{''}
   ``No,{''} said Case, turning it over; ``but it's a weapon. It's
   virus.{''}},

Title = {Cost-effectiveness of adalimumab for rheumatoid arthritis in Germany},
Journal = {ZEITSCHRIFT FUR RHEUMATOLOGIE},

Abstract = {In Germany, the clinical use of TNF-alpha inhibitors in the therapy of
   rheumatoid arthritis (RA) grew from 2 \% of treated patients in 2000 to
   20 \% in 2008. In 2012, adalimumab was the bestselling drug in the
   statutory health insurance system with net expenditure of a,notsign 581
   mio.
   We aim to analyze the cost-effectiveness of adalimumab for the treatment
   of RA in Germany.
   We set up an individual patient sampling lifetime model to simulate
   10,000 hypothetical patients. The patients' functional status improves
   according to American College of Rheumatology response criteria. In each
   6aEuromonth cycle, treatment might be discontinued due to loss of
   efficacy or adverse events.
   In the base case, patients gain 7.07 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)
   with conventional synthetic therapy and 9.92 QALYs if adalimumab
   combination therapy is added to the treatment algorithm. The incremental
   cost-utility ratio (ICUR) is a,notsign 24,492 based on German list
   prices. After deducting mandatory rebates and taxes, the ICUR is
   a,notsign 17,277, comparing favorably to analyses in other countries.
   Adalimumab combination therapy lowers indirect costs from a,notsign
   162,698 to a,notsign 134,363. The ICUR based on total costs is a,notsign
   14,550 (a,notsign 7,335 after deducting taxes and rebates). Sensitivity
   analysis shows that adalimumab combination therapy becomes a dominant
   treatment option for younger baseline populations, i. e. adalimumab is
   both more effective and less expensive for baseline age 30 due to
   savings in indirect costs.
   Our complex probabilistic model shows that estimation of
   cost-effectiveness for RA relies on the incorporation of indirect costs
   and a sufficiently long simulation horizon to capture the complete range
   of possible outcomes and the associated long-term benefits of biological
   treatment.},

Abstract = {In many two-sided markets we observe that there is a common distributor
   on one side of the market. One example is the TV industry, where TV
   channels choose advertising prices to maximize own profit and typically
   delegate determination of viewer prices to independent distributors. We
   show that in such a market structure the stronger the competition
   between the TV channels, the greater will joint profits in the TV
   industry be. We also show that joint profits may be higher if the
   wholesale contract between each TV channel and the distributor consists
   of a simple fixed fee rather than a two-part tariff. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {A CONSUMER-WELFARE APPROACH TO NETWORK NEUTRALITY REGULATION OF THE
   INTERNET},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {349-474},

Abstract = {``Network neutrality{''} is the shorthand for a proposed regime of
   economic regulation for the Internet. Because of the trend to deliver
   traditional telecommunications services, as well as new forms of content
   and applications, by Internet protocol (IP), a regime of network
   neutrality regulation would displace or subordinate a substantial
   portion of existing telecommunications regulation. If the United States
   adopts network neutrality regulation, other industrialized nations
   probably will soon follow. As a result of their investment to create
   next-generation broadband networks, network operators have the ability
   to innovate inside the network by offering both senders and receivers of
   information greater bandwidth and prioritization of delivery. Network
   neutrality regulation would, among other things, prevent providers of
   broadband Internet access service (such as digital subscriber line (DSL)
   or cable modem service) from offering a guaranteed, expedited delivery
   speed in return for the payment of a fee. The practical effect of
   banning such differential pricing (called ``access tiering{''} by its
   critics) would be to prevent the pricing of access to content or
   applications providers according to priority of delivery. To the extent
   that an advertiser of a good or service would be willing to contract
   with a network operator for advertising space on the network operator's
   affiliated content, another practical effect of network neutrality
   regulation would be to erect a barrier to vertical integration of
   network operators into advertising-based business models that could
   supplement or replace revenues earned from their existing usage-based
   business models. Moreover, by making end-users pay for the full cost of
   broadband access, network neutrality regulation would deny broadband
   access to the large number of consumers who would not be able to afford,
   or who would not have a willingness to pay for, what would otherwise be
   less expensive access. For example, Google is planning to offer
   broadband access to end-users for free in San Francisco by charging
   other content providers for advertising. This product offering is
   evidently predicated on the belief that many end-users demand discounted
   or free broadband access that is paid for by parties other than
   themselves. Proponents of network neutrality regulation argue that such
   restrictions on the pricing policies of network operators are necessary
   to preserve innovation on the edges of the network, as opposed to
   innovation within the network. However, recognizing that network
   congestion and real-time applications demand some differential pricing
   according to bandwidth or priority, proponents of network neutrality
   regulation would allow broadband Internet access providers to charge
   higher prices to end-users (but not content or applications providers)
   who consume more bandwidth or who seek priority delivery of certain
   traffic. Thus, the debate over network neutrality is essentially a
   debate over how best to finance the construction and maintenance of a
   broadband network in a two-sided market in which senders and receivers
   have additive demand for the delivery of a given piece of
   information-and hence additive willingness to pay. Well-established
   tools of Ramsey pricing from regulatory economics can shed light on
   whether network congestion and recovery of sunk investment in
   infrastructure are best addressed by charging providers of content and
   applications, broadband users, or both for expedited delivery.
   Apart from this pricing problem, an analytically simpler component of
   proposed network neutrality regulaion would prohibit a network operator
   from denying its users access to certain websites and Internet
   applications, such as voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). Although some
   instances of blocking of VoIP have been reported, such conduct is not a
   serious risk to competition. To address this concern, I analyze whether
   market forces (that is, competition among access providers) and existing
   regulatory structures are sufficient to protect broadband users. I
   conclude that economic welfare would be maximized by allowing access
   providers to differentiate services vis-a-vis providers of content and
   applications in value-enhancing ways and by relying on existing legal
   regimes to protect consumers against the exercise of market power,
   should it exist.},

Abstract = {Our starting point is the following simple but potentially
   underappreciated observation: When assessing willingness to pay (WTP)
   for hedonic features of a product, the results of such measurement are
   influenced by the context in which the consumer makes her real or
   hypothetical choice or in which the questions to which she replies are
   set (such as in a contingent valuation analysis). This observation is of
   particular relevance when WTP regards sustainability, the `non-use
   value' of which does not derive from a direct (physical) sensation and
   where perceived benefits depend heavily on available information and
   deliberations. The recognition of such context sensitivity paves the way
   for a broader conception of consumer welfare (CW), and our proposed
   standard of `reflective WTP' may materially change the scope for private
   market initiatives with regards to sustainability, while keeping the
   analytical framework within the realm of the CW paradigm. In terms of
   practical implications, we argue, for instance, that actual purchasing
   decisions may prove insufficient to measure consumer appreciation of
   sustainability, as they may rather echo learnt but unreflected
   heuristics and may be subject to the specific shopping context, such as
   heavy price promotions. Also, while preferences may reflect the current
   social norm, the latter may change considerably over time as more
   consumers adapt their behaviour.},

Abstract = {We study competition in data-driven markets, where the cost of quality
   production decreases in the amount of machine-generated data about user
   preferences or characteristics. This gives rise to data-driven indirect
   network effects. We construct a dynamic model of R\&D competition, where
   duopolists repeatedly determine innovation investments. Such markets tip
   under very mild conditions, moving towards monopoly. After tipping,
   innovation incentives both for the dominant firm and the competitor are
   small. We show when a dominant firm can leverage its dominance to a
   connected market, thereby initiating a domino effect. Market tipping can
   be avoided if competitors share their user information.},

Abstract = {We study the impact of reductions in interchange fees on payment card

   volumes increased when interchange fees were reduced. Our results
   suggest that a 10\% reduction in the rate of decline per quarter in the

   merchant acceptance per quarter of up to 1.4\%. In addition, a 10\%
   increase in the rate of interaction of merchant acceptance and the total
   number of cards increased the rate of quarterly issuer transaction
   volumes up to 1.7\%.},

Title = {SHINING A LIGHT ON DARK PATTERNS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEGAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {43-109},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {Dark patterns are user interfaces whose designers knowingly confuse
   users, make it difficult for users to express their actual preferences,
   or manipulate users into taking certain actions. They typically exploit
   cognitive biases and prompt online consumers to purchase goods and
   services that they do not want or to reveal personal information they
   would prefer not to disclose. This article provides the first public
   evidence of the power of dark patterns. It discusses the results of the
   authors' two large-scale experiments in which representative samples of
   American consumers were exposed to dark patterns. In the first study,
   users exposed to mild dark patterns were more than twice as likely to
   sign up for a dubious service as those assigned to the control group,
   and users in the aggressive dark pattern condition were almost four
   times as likely to subscribe. Moreover, whereas aggressive dark patterns
   generated a powerful backlash among consumers, mild dark patterns did
   not. Less educated subjects were significantly more susceptible to mild
   dark patterns than their well-educated counterparts. The second study
   identified the dark patterns that seem most likely to nudge consumers
   into making decisions that they are likely to regret or misunderstand.
   Hidden information, trick question, and obstruction strategies were
   particularly likely to manipulate consumers successfully. Other
   strategies employing loaded language or generating bandwagon effects
   worked moderately well, while still others such as ``must act now{''}
   messages did not make consumers more likely to purchase a costly
   service. Our second study also replicated a striking result in the first
   experiment, which is that where dark patterns were employed the cost of
   the service offered to consumers became immaterial. Decision
   architecture, not price, drove consumer purchasing decisions. The
   article concludes by examining legal frameworks for addressing dark
   patterns. Many dark patterns appear to violate federal and state laws
   restricting the use of unfair and deceptive practices in trade.
   Moreover, in those instances where consumers enter into contracts after
   being exposed to dark patterns, their consent could be deemed voidable
   under contract law principles. The article also proposes that dark
   pattern audits become part of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s
   consent decree process. Dark patterns are presumably proliferating
   because firms' proprietary A-B testing has revealed them to be profit
   maximizing. We show how similar A-B testing can be used to identify
   those dark patterns that are so manipulative that they ought to be
   deemed unlawful.},

Abstract = {Firms often sell a basic good as well as ancillary ones. Hold-up
   concerns have led to ancillary good regulations, such as transparency
   and price caps. The hold-up narrative, however, runs counter to evidence
   in many retail settings where ancillary good prices are set below cost
   (e.g., free shipping or limited card surcharging in countries where the
   ``no-surcharge rule{''} was lifted). We argue that the key to unifying
   these conflicting narratives is that the seller may absorb partly or
   fully the ancillary good's cost so as not to miss sales on the basic
   good. A supplier with market power on the ancillary good market then
   takes advantage of cost absorption and jacks up its wholesale price.
   Hold-ups occur only when consumers are initially uninformed or naive
   about the drip price and shopping costs are high. The price of the basic
   good then acts as a signal of the drip price, since a high markup on the
   basic good makes the firm more wary of missed sales. Regardless of
   whether consumers are informed, uninformed but rational, or naive,
   mandating price transparency and banning loss-making on the ancillary
   good leads to (i) an efficient consumption of the ancillary good, and
   (ii) a reduction of its wholesale price, generating strict welfare
   gains.},

   into the present article and a paper written in collaboration with
   Helene Bourguignon. The present article develops the general theory. The
   companion paper focuses on an open card payment system, makes specific
   assumptions (in particular, it rules out repeat purchases, which play a
   prominent role in this article), considers the case of ``price
   coherence,{''} and compares cash discounts and card surcharges. The
