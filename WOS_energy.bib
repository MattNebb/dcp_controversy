Abstract = {We investigate the impact of competition policy enforcement on the
   functioning of European energy markets while accounting for sectoral
   regulation. For this purpose, we compile a novel dataset on the European
   Commission's (EC) and EU member states' competition policy decisions in
   energy markets and combine it with firm- and sector-level data. We find
   that EC merger policy has a positive and robust impact on (i) the level
   of competition, (ii) investment and (iii) productivity. This impact,
   however, only shows up in low-regulated sectors. Other competition
   policy tools-EC state aid control and anti-trust, as well as all member
   state policy variables-do not have a uniform effect on energy markets.
   Our findings are consistent with the idea that the EC's merger policy
   actions have been used to overcome obstacles to a well-functioning EU
   energy sector and may have contributed to the overall development of gas
   and electricity markets in Europe.},

Abstract = {This article provides an overview of economic analysis in three
   prominent merger investigations and litigations: Electrolux's proposed
   acquisition of General Electric's appliance division, Halliburton's bid
   for Baker Hughes, and United Airline's attempt to acquire additional
   airport slots at Newark Liberty International Airport. In each, the
   parties abandoned their proposed transaction after the Division had
   filed suit to block the acquisition. While we cannot recount all the
   analyses underpinning these outcomes, we hope to provide some insights
   into the challenges of enforcing antitrust law and the way in which
   economic analysis in particular is used to address those challenges.},

Title = {Long-term energy supply contracts in European competition policy: Fuzzy
   not crazy},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {37},
Number = {12},
Pages = {5399-5407},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Long-term supply contracts often have ambiguous effects on the
   competitive structure, investment and consumer welfare in the long term.
   In the new market context, these effects are likely to be worsened and
   thus even harder to assess. Since liberalization and especially since
   the release of the Energy Sector Inquiry in early 2007, the portfolio of
   long-term supply contracts of the former incumbents have become a
   priority for review by the European Commission and the national
   competition authorities. It is widely believed that European Competition
   authorities take a dogmatic view on these contracts and systemically
   emphasize the risk of foreclosure over their positive effects on
   investment and operation. This paper depicts the methodology that has
   emerged in the recent line of cases and argues that this interpretation
   is largely misguided. It shows that a multiple-step approach is used to
   reduce regulation costs and balance anti-competitive effects with
   potential efficiency gains. However, if an economic approach is now
   clearly implemented, competition policy is constrained by the procedural
   aspect of the legal process and the remedies imposed remain open for
   discussion. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Appropriate port regulation and competitive forces tend to be related to
   higher levels of operational and economic performance of ports. From a
   policy-making perspective, pursuing efficiency and securing competition
   in ports to reach a level playing field is a two-step process requiring
   (1) ex-ante regulations to set the rules that maximize the competition
   for the market, especially when the policy objective is to attract
   private operations to ports on competitive concession processes and (2)
   ex-post competition policy to monitor and preserve competition in the
   market. This paper studies port regulation in Latin America and the
   Caribbean (LAC) from a competition perspective, analyzing both ex-ante
   and ex-post policies implemented in the region. The analysis reveals
   that the competitive environment in LAC is low, giving room for possible
   anticompetitive practices in the LAC port sector. Since the end of the
   1990s, approximately 80\% of container terminals in the region were
   granted to only five companies. Chile and Mexico have been found to be
   the best practices in the region, with better conditions assuring robust
   competition in the market. The main policy implication from this
   analysis is the need for a stronger involvement of antitrust agencies
   throughout the port concession processes.},

Abstract = {This first review of the European Commission's Directorate General for
   Competition (DG COMP) gives an overview on DG COMP's mandate and the
   main developments of 2005. The discussion includes institutional and
   policy developments, as well as the main competition policy decisions
   and Court judgments in the merger, antitrust, and state aid areas. It is
   argued that the trend towards a more effects-based analysis in EU
   competition policy had an impact on the assessment of competition cases,
   as well as on the development of soft law. For example, the
   effects-based approach was put high on the agenda with the publication
   of the Article 82 discussion paper. Similarly, the publication of the
   State Aids Action Plan (SAAP) launched a ``more economic approach{''} in
   European state aid assessment. In line with its objective to focus
   resources on key sectors, two major inquiries were launched in the
   energy and financial sectors.},

Abstract = {A basic framework is provided to explain the integration process
   experienced by oligopolistic markets serving a homogeneous good in
   different countries. Over the past few decades, such processes have been
   observed, for instance, in some European markets - in particular, in the
   energy sector. The idiosyncratic element here is the introduction of an
   exogenously given antitrust commission that supervises competition in
   the market and has the authority to fine firms for anticompetitive
   behavior. We model the unification decision as a simple cooperative
   non-transferable utility game. We find that the creation of an antitrust
   commission plays a major role in providing the necessary incentives for
   market unification. In particular, the commission is able to induce
   unification of all markets via appropriate choice of antitrust policy.
   This stands in stark contrast to the benchmark scenario in which the
   antitrust commission is absent - here, market unification never occurs.
   We propose the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) as a case study.},

Abstract = {The aim of the article is to evaluate the existing possibilities to
   regulate monopolies and oligopolies, and to determine, what form the
   public policy against monopoly should be implemented in the conditions
   of the Slovak Republic.
   When dealing with these issues, we have analysed the existing approaches
   of economic theory to the issue of interference or non-interference to
   the existence and operation of the monopoly (and oligopoly). We reviewed
   the possible benefits of regulation and the cost of regulation. We also
   compared the benefits of regulation with the benefits and negatives of
   non-interference into the imperfect market structure. On the basis of
   the experience of the implementation of antitrust policy in Slovakia, we
   have recommended changes in the approach of the state to the regulation
   of monopolies.
   Typical monopolies are usually power plants, distribution networks for
   elektricity, gasworks and waterworks. In most countries, these energy
   companies have arisen as a state businesses at the time, when was built
   the basic energy infrastructure. To date, little has changed in the
   world in this area. Gaz de France, Ruhrgas, Enel, Gazprom, E.ON, ?EZ and
   other companies remained state or parastatal. In Slovakia has taken
   place in this sector the extensive privatization. The paradox, however,
   is that these strategic enterprises (SPP and other) were sold to the
   state or parastatal companies in foreign countries. The result of this
   is the fact that today they employ only 3.2\% people in the industry,
   while their sales reaching up to 16.6\% of the entire industry. The
   total profit in this industry is up 48\%. Gross profitability of
   companies in the energy sector in Slovakia is almost three times higher
   in comparison with Germany. It is caused also by wrong state regulatory
   policy. As a result, they are extremely high profits of companies and
   high prices of energy in Slovakia.
   There are three options for resolving this situation. The first option
   is to provide a substantially stronger regulation of the final prices
   for retail customers and wholesalers. The second option consists in a
   special taxation for these companies. A third option is to buy back
   shares of these companies.},

Abstract = {Long-term vertical contracts remain a pervasive feature of European
   electricity markets and despite wide concerns over the ability of
   de-integrated markets to ensure an optimal allocation of risks, the
   Commission has constantly voiced strong concerns over their
   anti-competitive effects. However, due to the lack of decisions in
   electricity and the on-going modernization of EC competition policy,
   perceived legal uncertainty is strong. This article proposes to explore
   the degree of uncertainty in the Commission decisional practice
   following the recent line of cases in other energy sectors. The article
   comes up with two conclusions. First, legal uncertainty is largely
   overstated as both the methodology to analyze these contracts in energy
   and its implementation principles are clearly emerging. Second,
   competition enforcement in energy quickly converges with enforcement in
   other sectors.},

Abstract = {In November 2006, the German Federal Ministry of Economics sent a
   ministerial draft bill on combating price abuses in the energy supply
   and food trade sectors to the trade associations for comment. The bill
   trust be seen as part of a set of measures of the federal government
   seeking to improve conditions for more competition in the energy sector.
   An omnibus law is to add a new Seetion 29 to the Act against
   Restrictions on Competition (Antitrust Act). The addition is to bear the
   heading of ``Power Economy{''} and has been designed to prevent a
   utility (vendor of electricity, gas, and district heat) from abusing its
   position on a market which it dominates either alone or together with
   other utility companies.
   Depending on the interests involved, comments on the draft bills differ.
   On the whole, this tightening up of antitrust legislation is perceived
   more as a repair job. Stricter antitrust provisions absolutely must also
   be seen in their European dimension. European firms not falling under
   this stricter antitrust law enjoy advantages over German firms.},

Abstract = {Consumer choice is increasingly recognised as a crucial factor in
   competition policy. To illustrate the implications of such choice we
   present an investment model of the switching choice in the UK
   residential natural gas market and examine responses to a specially
   commissioned survey of nearly seven hundred consumers, identifying
   search and switching costs. Through an assessment of the savings which
   consumers say they require to switch supplier, together with an
   evaluation of consumer switching behaviour, we deduce that the incumbent
   retained considerable market power, suggesting that some continued
   regulation may be necessary.},

Abstract = {Serbia together with other republic of former Yugoslavia for decades has
   developed specific mix of plan and market mechanism. Its economic
   structure was unfavorable taking into account too high share of primary
   and secondary sector within GDP formation, high share of energy, food
   and raw material production within industry on the one side, and low
   share of service in GDP formation and low involvement of SMEs and
   private sector within economy, on the other. Its export products were
   not competitive abroad. This economic structure became even worsen
   during the 1990s (the share of agriculture, energy and food production
   in GDP formation became even higher then before), mainly due to non
   economic reasons (split of market of former Yugoslavia and because of
   overall sanctions introduced by World community). Serbia has started
   transition as the last among Central and Eastern European countries at
   late 2000. Instead of a holistic development strategy and strategy of
   transition an extreme neo liberal approach prevailed. So, GDP growth,
   although encouraging, was suboptimal, macroeconomic and development
   policies were not well coordinated and pure economic rational in
   decision making process on company level prevailed. High rate of growth
   was achieved due to high public spending and increasing in PB deficit.
   So, Serbia is facing non sustainable development in medium - term not
   only because of world (financial) crisis, but because of its own growth
   limits mainly. Its export is still non competitive on the world market.
   Regarding market reforms the first phase is finished, but reforming
   processes lost momentum in 2008. So, Stabilization and Association
   Agreement with EU could be seen as powerful vehicle for further, more
   qualitative reforms, like it used to be in other transitory countries.},

Volume = {12},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {502-517},
Abstract = {4 European energy policy dates back to the founding days of integration,
   yet the emergence of supranational governance is a recent development.
   The article examines the extent to which European policymakers have
   succeeded in building up governance capacity, and what the facilitating
   and impeding factors were that have shaped the governance mix. The
   conceptual framework differentiates between orders of governance in the
   multilevel context, and between policy modes involving hierarchical and
   non-hierarchical settings and varying actor constellations. The article
   finds that governance capacity has emerged where second order governance
   (institutional and procedural rules) is concerned, while first order
   governance (the concrete policy process) remains the remit of national
   and private actors. This becomes even more obvious once the interaction
   between policy modes is taken into account: governance networks enhance
   governance capacity in the area of competition policy and agency
   governance; self-regulation by industry constitutes a fall-back option
   in case of insufficient governance capacity on cross-border issues; soft
   governance helps to bridge multiple policy areas and levels of
   governance. The article concludes that second order governance may prove
   effective where it combines with hierarchy but that it may fail to
   overcome both trade-offs between contradicting goals and resistance at
   lower levels.},

Abstract = {We use data from a consumer survey to uncover factors deterring consumer
   switching in liberalised residential energy markets in The Netherlands.
   We find that actual or perceived switching costs represent an important
   barrier for switching energy suppliers. This enables incumbent firms to
   charge higher markups than entrants. We analyse the welfare consequences
   of switching costs in two scenarios, a pessimistic one in which
   switching costs remain at the level measured in the survey and an
   optimistic one in which they decline enough for the market to reach a
   competitive equilibrium level. The paper concludes with a discussion of
   policy options for reducing switching costs.},

Title = {Household demand for electricity: The role of market distortions and
   prices in competition policy},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {134},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper examines residential demand for electricity in Sri Lanka
   using survey data collected over a five-year period between 2011 and
   2015. The study finds that the major determinants of demand for
   residential electricity are the result of price or market distortions
   (i.e. subsidies), socioeconomic variables and energy saving technology.
   The effects of these variables are particularly relevant to competition
   policy. Estimated elasticities with respect to average price, subsidies
   under marginal cost pricing, subsidies under average cost pricing and
   income are found to be -0.015, 0.021, 0.036 and 0.046 respectively. We
   find that demand for electricity is inelastic and is categorised as a
   normal good. However, elasticities with respect to subsidy variables are
   found to be higher than the price variable. This implies, that under an
   increasing block rate system any price change used as a policy measure
   to control electricity consumption will not be effective. This is
   because price changes could alter the subsidy received by the consumer
   and therefore reverse the objective of the price change. Further,
   results of this study find that price and elasticities with respect to
   subsidy variables are relatively higher for low income groups while
   income elasticity is relatively larger for high income groups.},

Abstract = {A fundamental question facing the regulatory and competition authorities
   is whether to delegate competition policy issues of utilities to
   regulatory agencies or competition authorities. While, some countries
   prefer `light handed regulation' by competition authorities, others
   grant substantial power to independent regulatory agencies. Turkey
   followed the liberalization wave in electricity with a regulatory reform
   in 2001. Recently, a slight shift of tide has appeared in previously
   liberalized markets. Electricity markets are the forefront example of
   this change of course. A similar trend is apparent in Turkey as well.
   Increasing pressures on prices and excess demand have created more
   reasons for active government involvement. As political factors weigh
   in, economic considerations take a secondary place in electricity
   markets. In order to show the tension between political and economic
   preferences, we use the Pareto and Kaldor-Hicks criteria of welfare
   economics metaphorically. This paper discusses the scope of competition
   policy in the Turkish electricity industry. We focus on the issue of
   regulatory governance. The absence of a well established institutional
   environment reduces the potential role of competition policy in the
   industry and increase political meddling in all segments of the Turkish
   electricity market. By looking into changes in prices, market power and
   new entry closely, we discuss the relative success of the regulatory
   reform in the electricity industry. We conclude by emphasizing the
   consequences of a passive competition authority in establishing a
   competitive electricity market.},

Abstract = {In this paper we try to bridge the gap between the outcome ambitions of
   competition policy in terms of welfare gains and consumer surplus and
   the longer term effects of competition policy on growth and employment.
   First of all, an overview is given of the different definitions of
   welfare. We explain why maximising the consumer surplus is an important
   part of the mission statement for most competition authorities. In the
   second part of the paper we estimate the impact of the introduction of
   the competition law on economic development. The effects of antitrust
   policies, merger control and energy regulation on the consumer surplus
   appear substantial. This increase in consumer surplus can be interpreted
   as a cut in the ``market power wedge{''} which, from a modelling point
   of view, is comparable to a cut in the tax wedge. A model simulation for
   the Netherlands shows that the economy responded positively to this
   increase in the consumer surplus. We find that production has grown by
   an extra 0.5\% and that employment has increased by 0.4\% as a result of
   the enforcement of the Competition Law.},

Abstract = {Deregulation requires a shift entirely from regulatory economics to
   industrial-organization economics. Effective competition requires parity
   among competitors and an avoidance of cooperation. The specific criteria
   for effective competition include (in most cases) at least 5 reasonably
   comparable rivals, no single-firm dominance, and reasonably free entry.
   Premature deregulation, before those conditions are reached, is a
   cardinal error and is usually irreversible.
   Important electricity markets may never reach those conditions, and so
   special caution is needed in removing regulatory protections. Current
   antitrust policies and resources tend to be weak, which accentuates the
   need for FERC to apply strict antitrust criteria about mergers and
   strategic price discrimination.},

Abstract = {Market definition is a crucial component of antitrust policy. There is,
   however, no universally accepted method of carrying out market
   definition. While several approaches have been presented in the
   literature, each has its share of drawbacks. This paper suggests that a
   modeling technique based upon the theory of arbitrage is well suited to
   answering this question. After the empirical approach is presented, it
   is used to calculate antitrust market definitions between electricity
   hubs in the American West. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Title = {Are anticompetitive behaviours rampant in global retail energy markets?
   A study of price elasticity, asymmetric price adjustment and
   rent-seeking},
Journal = {ENERGY RESEARCH \& SOCIAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {70},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study investigated the role of price elasticity in the asymmetric
   adjustment of global retail energy prices and in the rent-seeking
   behavior of retail energy firms. Overall, 58 nonlinear ARDL models were
   estimated for the period 2004:M12 - 2016M8 using data for gasoline,
   automotive diesel, domestic heating oil, industrial fuel oil and crude
   oil markets. The results indicate that global retail energy markets are
   still pervasively fraught with the problems of rockets and feathers
   effect and the likelihood of retailers manipulating the tax system to
   hide rent seeking behaviors. The results also indicate that there is
   more likelihood of rent-seeking activities in the markets for road fuels
   whose demand is relatively more price-inelastic than in the markets for
   non-road fuels whose demand is relatively more price-elastic, thereby
   suggesting that differences in market structure could offer a possible
   explanation for rent-seeking and asymmetric price adjustment in global
   retail energy markets. These results have far-reaching antitrust and
   consumer welfare implications, which require regulators and policy
   makers to interminably monitor the global retail energy markets,
   especially during periods of economic crisis like the ongoing COVID-19
   pandemic, in order to safeguard the overall social welfare.},

Title = {Energy efficiency and renewables policies: Promoting efficiency or

Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {3954-3965},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The cliche in the electricity sector, the ``cheapest power plant is the
   one we don't build,{''} neglects the benefits of the energy that plant
   would generate. That economy-wide perspective need not apply in
   considering benefits to only consumers if not building that plant was
   the exercise of monopsony power. A regulator maximizing consumer welfare
   may need to avoid rationing demand at monopsony prices. Subsidizing
   energy efficiency to reduce electricity demand at the margin can solve
   that problem, if energy efficiency and electricity use are substitutes.
   Renewable energy subsidies, percentage use standards, or feed in tariffs
   may also serve monopsony as well with sufficient inelasticity in fossil
   fuel electricity supply. We may not observe these effects if the
   regulator can set price as well as quantity, lacks buyer-side market
   power, or is legally precluded from denying generators a reasonable
   return on capital. Nevertheless, the possibility of monopsony remains
   significant in light of the debate as to whether antitrust enforcement
   should maximize consumer welfare or total welfare. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {This Note examines the potential application of the Sherman Antitrust
   Act to alleged market manipulations by wholesale electricity generators
   during the California electricity crisis. Viewed in light of the
   national movement toward electricity deregulation, this Note summarizes
   accusations and reports of possible market power abuse by generators
   operating in California. This Note then analyzes the application of the
   Sherman Act to those alleged abuses. It determines that section I of the
   Sherman Act provides appropriate remedies for past market power abuse
   and serves as a sufficient deterrent to avoid similar abuse in the
   future. Due to the particular nature of the California electricity
   market, however, three antitrust immunities would constrain application
   of the Sherman Act. The broadest sweeping of the three, the filed rate
   doctrine, would likely preclude all private civil section I actions
   against the wholesale electricity generators. While it appears the
   doctrine's particularly poor fit to the facts of the crisis militates
   against its application, courts will likely invoke the doctrine,
   immunizing wholesale electricity generators from section I and leaving
   enforcement responsibilities solely in the power of the Federal Energy
   Regulatory Commission. The final section of this Note assesses the
   abilities of FERC to provide effective enforcement mechanisms to remedy
   and deter market power abuse in electricity markets. Finding those
   mechanisms inadequate, this Note concludes by calling upon Congress to
   overrule the filed rate doctrine.},

Title = {Reconsidering the European regulation of merchant transmission
   investment in light of the third energy package: The role of dominant
   generators},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {The regulation of merchant transmission investment (MTI) has become an
   important issue in the EU electricity sector, subsequent to the granting
   of authorizations by European authorities to five merchant projects:
   BritNed, Estlink, the East West Cables, NorGer and recently a merchant
   line connecting Italy and Austria. The creation of a new Agency for the
   Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) at the EU level, which has
   decision-making powers on MTI, therefore presents a unique opportunity
   to question and re-design the current European policy. This paper shows
   that the recent decisions concerning MTI may suffer a strong bias
   against dominant electricity generators while incumbent Transmission
   System Operators (TSOs) or new entrant TSOs are generally favored by
   national regulators and the European Commission (EC). This strategy is
   misguided as it fails to recognize both the new incentives of generators
   to develop MTI and the conflict of interest between the regulated and
   non-regulated activities of incumbent TSOs. Letting dominant generators
   undertake MTI is indeed generally beneficial as long as potential abuses
   of dominance are mitigated. To deter possible anti-competitive effects,
   we propose a new and feasible allocation of regulatory powers based on a
   clear demarcation between the market monitoring powers of ACER and the
   antitrust powers of the EC (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {NCP provides a framework for reform ranging from the introduction of
   competition in energy and water services to the dismantling of
   agricultural marketing boards. The effects on consumers will depend upon
   whether their interests are narrowly construed as preoccupations with
   price and choice of services or whether they extend to broad social
   justice and equity considerations. The `marketisation' of government
   services is nor concerned with distributional equity, and budget funding
   of CSOs is necessary to address distributional inequities. But domestic
   consumers will remain captive to monopoly franchises and competition
   objectives add pressure for the `contracting out' of government services
   and the winding back of cross-subsidies which have traditionally
   operated in favour of household consumers.
   NCP will transform the public from `citizen' to `consumer'. Consumer
   advocates have risen to these new challenges and grasped the opportunity
   presented by industry restructuring to propose a range of mechanisms for
   consumer empowerment. This article will briefly identify some of the key
   issues for consumers in the implementation of the NCP and demonstrate
   the complexity of any attempt to assess the threats and opportunities
   for consumers. Particular attention will be given to the reforms to the
   electricity industries in NSW and Victoria.},

Title = {Determinants of renewable energy production in transition economies: A
   panel data approach},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {191},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Over the past several years, the analysis of the determinants of
   renewable energy production has become an increasingly popular topic in
   academic research and governmental policy around the globe. However,
   many questions about these factors, especially in the transition
   economies in Central and Eastern Europe and the Caucasus and Central
   Asia, remain unanswered. To address this gap, this paper presents novel
   empirical evidence on the primary economic and political factors shaping
   transitions to a low carbon economy via renewable energy generation in
   post-socialist countries. Using extensive data from 27 transition
   economies over the years 1990-2014, it has been found that higher
   economic growth and rising level of unemployment and government debt
   acted as stimulators of renewable energy generation. The implementation
   of the Kyoto Protocol also led to the significant increase in renewables
   utilization. Furthermore, increasing CO2 emissions per capita, the
   implementation of the competition policy and deteriorating
   competitiveness within the energy market significantly limited
   production of energy from renewable sources. The findings also suggest
   that since the beginning of the last global financial crisis in 2007
   reinforcement of competition within energy market and additional public
   funding had a much stronger role to play as factors stimulating
   renewables deployment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the main competition issues that arise in
   electricity systems dominated by hydro generation, arguing that
   technological differences between hydro and thermal plants may allow
   hydropower producers to exert market power in different and subtler ways
   compared to thermal generators. The key for market power in hydro-based
   systems is the strategic allocation of a given amount of output across
   periods, rather than a straightforward reduction of total output. The
   paper examines the interaction between strategic hydro reservoir
   operation and transmission capacity constraints, and summarizes the
   implications of market power for system reliability. A review of recent
   relevant literature is included. Finally, possible interventions to
   mitigate market power are analysed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This paper considers firms' incentives to merge under imperfect
   competition, where we allow for product differentiation, cost
   asymmetries, and pollution intensities (green and brown goods). We first
   analyze mergers in the absence of environmental regulation, showing that
   mergers induce an output shift towards the lowest cost firm. When
   emission fees are introduced, however, firms also consider their
   relative pollution intensities, potentially reverting the above output
   shift. We show that socially excessive mergers can arise when firms
   shift output to the more cost-efficient firm which may cause more
   pollution. In contrast, socially insufficient mergers can arise if
   output shifts reduce pollution. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The Sherman Act, with its origin in the Populist and Progresive eras,
   was enacted to break up `trusts' like the Standard Oil Company, a
   vertically and horizontally integrated exploration and production
   company. Over 100 years later, the DOJ challenged the proposed merger of
   Halliburton and Baker Hughes, two oil-field services companies. The
   government feared that the merger would potentially raise prices of
   servces provided by these companies to E\&P companies, which are some of
   the largest corporations in the world and include many direct
   descendants of Standard Oil. Energy is of great importance to the US
   economy. As a result, it is closely scrutinized by the US antitrust
   agencies-the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. This
   article summarizes US antitrust laws and their origins, describes recent
   changes in the oil and gas industry, explains how those changes have
   influenced the enforcement articles of the DOJ and FTC, reviews the
   current industry and antitrust trends, identifies likely enforcement
   activity in the near future and discusses the potential effect of the
   US's 2016 Presidential election on antitrust enforcement.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between regulation and innovation
   from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. The theoretical model
   focuses on the role of competition policy (measured by increases in the
   number of firms) and the strength of intellectual property rights in
   fostering cost-reducing R\&D, under both R\&D competition and R\&D
   cooperation. It is shown that, theoretically, competition policy and
   intellectual property rights are complements under R\&D competition,
   while they are substitutes under R\&D cooperation. Moreover, under R\&D
   competition, innovation is maximized through strict competition policy
   and strong intellectual property rights; whereas under R\&D cooperation,
   innovation is maximized through strict competition policy and weak
   intellectual property rights. The empirical model tests the effect of
   several regulatory policies on innovation in several MENA countries. The
   results of dynamic panel data regressions point that competition policy
   and intellectual property rights are complements. In addition to
   competition policy and intellectual property rights protection, the
   following country/regulation characteristics are considered: human
   capital, government efficiency, foreign direct investment, natural
   resources dependence, labor market regulations, and GDP level. The paper
   finds that the extent of regulations in all categories has statistically
   significant effects on R\&D, except FDI. One explanation is that most
   FDI to the MENA region flows to natural resources and non-tradable
   sectors, which are less relevant to R\&D than other sectors (e.g.,
   manufacturing and information and communications technology sectors).},

Abstract = {Long-term natural gas contracts and their specific features are at the
   forefront of legal and policy discussions around the world. Issues like
   oil price indexation and price reviews, flexibility and take-or-pay
   clauses or a move to shorter term trading are being debated. This is
   particularly true for Europe where major changes are taking place, but
   also in places like Australia and Asia.
   This study will focus on the antitrust treatment of long-term
   take-or-pay natural gas contracts and their specific provisions in the
   European Union and the United States. It will also examine the
   regulatory treatment of these contracts and the regulatory environment
   in which these contracts operate. Issues that are covered include
   questions on duration and volumes, take-or-pay provisions and oil
   indexation, destination or use restrictions, vertical integration and
   monopolization.},

Abstract = {Fundamental changes in the electrical energy sector are drawing on
   serious implications leading to high heterogeneity in both supply and
   demand. One focal point in transitioning to the smart grid vision is the
   liberalization and deregulation of electricity markets, which are
   undergoing a transformation towards accommodating a more decentralized
   and sustainable provision of energy. As the number of traders in the
   market is increasing steadily and the trading activities are becoming
   more complex, the energy markets are becoming more exposed to potential
   fraud. In this paper we address the problem of detecting collusive
   behavior, where a group of individual traders act together,
   inconsistently with the competitive model, to artificially manipulate
   the market and elicit illegal profits. We investigate collusion attacks
   in the energy market and propose a novel mechanism, showing the
   effectiveness and practical applicability of our method to real
   scenarios. Thus, while economic analysis does not imply proving guilt,
   it can be instrumental in making decisions about identifying market
   participants worthy of closer inspection from appointed antitrust
   authorities.},

Abstract = {Antitrust and competition laws are designed to protect the free markets
   and promote competition in order to assure a dynamic and efficient
   economy and to provide competitive prices for quality products and
   services. They apply to mergers and acquisitions as well as to joint
   ventures especially among competitor companies who possess market power
   and these include collaborations on research and development. If it is
   determined that these actions are likely to substantially prevent or
   lessen competition the courts might dissolve, stop, alternate them, etc.
   Two new factors affect this process today: The role of new technologies
   and the markets globalization. They both have a considerable effect on
   the way these laws are interpreted by the courts and on their eventual
   amendments in order to reflect the new reality. A new applied technology
   and the globalization separately or together may change the factors that
   determine how anticompetitive a merger or acquisition between
   competitors may be and may also serve as a basis for amending the
   antitrust and competition laws. In this paper, a short review of the
   recent mergers and acquisitions of various companies has been carried
   out along with an abridged analysis of the current antitrust and
   competition laws in USA, Canada and European Union in the view of their
   capacity to handle the new reality. Some related court decisions are
   also examined and several examples are given in order to illustrate the
   influence of new technologies and globalization in interpreting the
   existing laws and on their amendment possibilities.},

Abstract = {Progress in market integration over the past two decades has come at the
   expense of growing flexibility in the laws that govern the single market
   (SM) as well as the way that these laws are implemented. This
   differentiated integration comes in four forms: soft; informal;
   multi-speed; and opt-out differentiation. We examine how the completion
   of the SM has been held back in the varied implementation of EU
   competition policy and variation in national corporate law, energy
   markets, services and taxation. These sectors and issue areas form the
   frontier in which the main political struggles over the future shape of
   the SM take place, and in which differentiation is most clearly
   manifested. The SM notion supposedly entails a concrete set of
   substantive policy commitments that form the basis of the `ever closer
   union'. However, increasing differentiation undermines the
   identification of the EU's core constitutional commitments.},

Abstract = {International security debates surrounding the European Union (EU)
   energy supply challenge commonly invoke the need for more EU hard power
   - e.g. getting tough on Russia or engaging directly with other
   exporters. This article investigates whether what might be labelled soft
   power with a hard edge' instead amounts to a consistent policy strategy
   for the EU. The central argument is that the EU has turned a weakness
   into strength, and developed a set of tools that sharpen the way soft
   power is exercised in the energy sector. The article explores how soft
   power affects companies that come and play' on the EU market: the rules
   of the Single European Market (SEM) and how they affect external firms.
   It also assesses the long reach of the SEM: both the gravitational pull'
   the SEM exerts in the near aboard', and the EU's push' to facilitate the
   development of midstream infrastructure and upstream investment. The
   conclusion is that the EU regulatory state is emerging as an
   international energy actor in its own right. It limits the ways states
   like Russia can use state firms in the geopolitical game; and it exports
   its model into the near abroad, thus stabilizing energy supply and
   transit routes.},

Title = {A liberal actor in a realist world? The Commission and the external
   dimension of the single market for energy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY},

Abstract = {This article investigates the European Commission's external energy
   policy through the lens of the regulatory state. It argues that because
   of the nature of its institutions, policy tools and resources, the
   Commission remains a liberal actor even as the world leaves the benign
   pro-market environment of the 1990s and becomes more mercantilist - or
   `realist'. The article tests seven hypotheses related to two key
   challenges as perceived by the Commission: building energy markets, and
   making them work. It finds that the Commission seeks to project the
   single market beyond its jurisdiction to deal with transit
   infrastructure problems; extend international regimes to cover energy
   trade; deal with monopolists such as Gazprom through classical
   competition policy; and fix global energy market failures with clear
   regulatory state tools. Importantly, however, some actions by the
   Commission can be seen as an attempt to counterbalance external actors,
   or as second-best efforts to address energy market failures.},

Abstract = {Economic theory gives no clear indication of the minimum number of
   producers necessary for a market to define competitive price-quantity
   equilibria, which approximate price equal to marginal cost. Previous
   work and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) guidelines
   generally suggest that 6-10 suppliers may be workably competitive. Our
   experiments with PowerWeb suggest that a higher number of suppliers may
   be necessary to approximate competitive market solutions, this in the
   absence of any communication among producers. As communications rules
   are altered to parallel differing types of antitrust enforcement, market
   results with 24 participants approach pure monopoly values. (C) 2004

Abstract = {This paper investigates how carbon taxes and feed-in tariffs as well as
   combinations of these regulations influence investment decisions in
   power generation under uncertainty. Moreover, we analyze the
   interactions between market power and regulation instruments. To this
   end, we numerically simulate a microeconomic investment model with a
   two-stage time structure, different kinds of uncertainty, market power
   settings and type-of-technology dependent cost structures for
   Switzerland using scenario analysis. Our results show that regulation
   instruments can significantly modify cost structures and change the
   respective profitability rankings of technologies. This alters the
   strategic behavior of the dominant market player and therewith overall
   investment patterns. The outcome of a policy regime is therefore
   strongly dependent on the degree of market liberalization and not only
   on the regulation instrument. Nevertheless, the share of electricity
   production derived from renewable energy sources is most effectively
   raised by a combination of political market interventions, including
   competition policy.},

Title = {Zombie Energy Laws},
Journal = {VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1077-1126},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This Article traces the development of three legal rules-cost recovery
   for vertically integrated utilities, the requirement that regulators
   assess the financial viability of energy projects before issuing a
   certificate of public convenience and necessity, and the filed rate
   doctrine-that emerged out of the view that electric power companies
   should be shielded from market forces. It argues that important elements
   of these legal rules have become ``zombie energy laws.{''} Zombie energy
   laws are statutes, regulations, and judicial precedents that continue to
   apply after their underlying economic and legal bases dissipate. Zombie
   energy laws were originally designed to protect consumers by, among
   other things, preventing utilities from exploiting their market power.
   Today, however, they protect incumbent fossil fuel generators and have
   provided the legal basis for invalidating billions of dollars of wind
   and solar projects. Thus, energy laws that emerged to mitigate market
   power abuses under the old system of utility rate regulation now
   entrench incumbent market power and are impeding the transition to a
   cleaner energy system. In this way, zombie energy laws are protecting
   incumbent energy companies from traditional tort, contract, and
   antitrust laws that prevent firms operating in ordinary industries from
   acting anticompetitively.
   This Article concludes by arguing that the Federal Power Act, which
   instructs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to maintain ``just
   and reasonable{''} wholesale rates, can plausibly be read to
   mitigate-and, in some cases, eliminate-the market distortions caused by
   zombie energy laws. The Act's meaning should be construed to fit the
   market structure to which it is being applied.},

Abstract = {We examine characteristics associated with consumer (dis)engagement in
   the residential electricity market, a topic of increasing policy
   interest and intervention, introducing consumer attitudes and marketing
   recall as new factors. General attitudes are closely associated with
   electricity market activity, with considerable variation in the strength
   and statistical significance of these relationships, indicating very
   different motivations amongst consumers. Recall of direct marketing
   routes has little identifiable effect, while advice of family and
   friends is influential. We identify implications for communication by
   both suppliers and policy makers seeking to improve the functioning of
   such markets, including the necessity for a variety of approaches.},

Abstract = {The factors most often cited as the causes of the California crisis are
   the scarcity of generation capacity, a flawed market design, and the
   venality of electricity producers. However, many of these attributes
   were present in other electricity markets. none of which have suffered
   through anything like the California crisis. The only factor not seen in
   other markets in the world is the lack of contracts or other forms of
   long-term supply arrangements. Policy efforts are therefore best
   directed at developing a regulatory and retail environment where
   contracts are freely entered into at prices reflective of underlying
   market conditions. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Do LPG prices react to the entry of natural gas? Implications for
   competition policy},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {152},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In developing countries, the penetration of Liquefied Petroleum Gas
   (LPG) is still high, and hence the entry of Natural Gas (NG) networks
   coexists with the use of LPG by an important fraction of households. A
   relevant policy question is whether the degree of horizontal integration
   between NG and LPG providers has an influence on the level of retail
   prices. Using self-reported retail prices of the largest LPG provider in
   Chile during years 2013 and 2014, we estimate that the presence of a
   competing NG network generates an average decrease of LPG retail prices
   within the range {[}-4\%,-2\%]. This result suggests that the degree of
   horizontal integration between NG and LPG providers should matter, in
   particular for policy interventions such as merger control by
   competition authorities and the granting of concessions for deploying NG
   networks by sectoral regulators.},

Abstract = {UK governments and the energy regulator have shown increasing concern
   about the health of competition in the residential energy market,
   following their pioneering deregulation at the end of the last century.
   We identify the effects of introducing the non-discrimination clauses in
   2009, a major regulatory intervention and the first since deregulation.
   We explore the effect of this intervention on the price movements of the
   six major players, and find that the nature of competition in the
   industry has changed, with less effective rivalry between the regional
   incumbents and large regional competitors following the intervention;
   companies seem to have `retreated' to their home regions, leaving a
   market where pricing behaviour resembles more closely a duopoly between
   British Gas and the regional incumbent.},

Journal = {ENERGY ECONOMICS},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper analyses the incidence of specific taxes in fuel markets, and
   exploits the findings to simulate the effects of government
   interventions aimed at mitigating oil price fluctuations. Several
   reduced-form model specifications are estimated to study tax incidence,
   using wholesale equilibrium prices for both gasoline and motor diesel in
   the Italian fuel industry over the period 1996-2007 as dependent
   variables. We then assess the impact on fuel prices stemming from the
   creation of an automatic fiscal mechanism consisting of reductions in
   specific taxes matching the rise in oil prices. Our evidence supports
   the idea that ``flexible{''} taxation mechanisms focused only on excise
   taxes could not be a viable policy for stabilizing the price level in
   fuel markets and more complex policies (based also on ad valorem taxes)
   are needed. Alternative interventions to control prices can be designed
   focusing on the market structure of these industries, where Antitrust
   Authority could play a significant role. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {STRUCTURAL CHANGE, EXCHANGE RATE AND THE ASYMMETRIC ADJUSTMENT OF RETAIL
   ENERGY PRICES IN EUROPE},
Journal = {PRAGUE ECONOMIC PAPERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {196-234},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper examines the role of structural change in the asymmetric
   adjustment of retail energy prices following changes in crude oil costs.
   The paper also examines the pattern of adjustment in retail energy
   prices when exchange rate is accounted for as part of the marginal cost
   of importing crude oil in European countries with high oil import
   dependency ratio. The paper shows that the results of Greenwood-Nimmo
   and Shin (2013) no longer hold when the structural change in the
   relationship between retail energy prices and crude oil costs is taken
   into the consideration. The paper also cautions that studies like
   Kristoufek and Lunackova (2014) that failed to account for exchange rate
   as part of the marginal cost of importing oil for countries with high
   oil import dependency ratio may be misleading. In fact, the results of
   this paper further indicate that once the exchange rate effect is taken
   into consideration, the possibility of rent-seeking behaviour in the
   gasoline markets of Italy and Spain disappears; while the rockets and
   feathers effect observed in most of the ex-tax gasoline, diesel,
   domestic heating oil and industrial fuel oil markets vanishes.},

Abstract = {Many consumers do not take advantage of lower energy prices available in
   liberalized retail markets. We provide evidence to explain why consumers
   may leave substantial amounts of ``money on the table{''} in this way.
   We observe real decisions made by over 7,000 consumers in a collective
   switching auction, supplemented by their responses to a survey. We
   identify factors which may inhibit switching and show that expectations
   of high switching rates in an unregulated market may be unrealistic. Our
   findings have important implications for the design and regulation of
   energy markets, including imposition of price caps on `` default{''}
   retail tariffs in 2019 in the UK and parts of Australia.},

Title = {Oil and power: the effectiveness of state threats on markets},
Journal = {REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Abstract = {To what extent can the threat of state regulatory or legal action affect
   an industry's behavior? The question is relevant to a broad range of
   industries, from energy to technology companies, and is made especially
   salient by a transatlantic divide in regulatory approaches. We argue
   that state action can generate large behavioral effects, and use cases
   from the oil industry to support that claim. During the middle of the
   twentieth century, the global oil industry was dominated by an oligopoly
   of international oil companies called the Seven Sisters, including
   today's ExxonMobil, Chevron, and BP. Despite their great market power,
   the Seven Sisters chose to keep prices extraordinarily stable at
   moderate levels. Why did they not raise prices, as the OPEC nations did
   in the 1970s, or lower prices to destroy their competition? We argue
   that the Seven Sisters could have manipulated prices in various ways,
   but they were constrained by political risks. The privileged position of
   the Seven Sisters required the tolerance, and sometimes the active
   support, of governments in both the consumer and producer countries. Our
   findings have implications for the study of oligopolies and antitrust
   enforcement, and for governance efforts to avoid climate change.},

Title = {International Trade Law Challenges by Subsidies for Renewable Energy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {49},
Number = {5},
Pages = {757-780},
Abstract = {Although it is widely acknowledged that the replacement of conventional
   `grey' energy with renewable `green' energy is an important pillar of
   climate change mitigation, the question of how governments can support
   this development remains highly contested. In Canada - Renewable Energy,
   a domestic support measure for renewable energy generation has been
   subject if dispute settlement proceedings before the World Trade
   Organization (WTO) for the first time. In this ruling, the concept of
   `relevant market' which forms part of the subsidy analysis proved to be
   highly controversial. By looking at the delineation of the relevant
   market and the conditions justifying subsidies, this article takes up
   this debate and examines the degree of policy space that is conferred to
   WTO Members in supporting their renewable energy sector. It discusses
   possible solutions to overcome the legal insecurity emanating from the
   blurry concept of `relevant market' by arguing that a comparison between
   the WTO law and antitrust law can yield valuable insights to establish a
   more consistent approach for assessing the relevant market.},

Title = {Abuse of dominance and antitrust enforcement in the German electricity
   market},
Journal = {ENERGY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {92},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In 2008, the European Commission investigated E.ON, a large and
   vertically integrated electricity company, for the alleged abuse of a
   joint dominant position by strategically withholding generation capacity
   in the German wholesale electricity market. The case was settled after
   E.ON agreed to divest 5 GW generation capacity as well as its extra-high
   voltage network. We analyze the effect of these divestitures on
   wholesale electricity prices. Our identification strategy is based on
   the observation that energy suppliers have more market power during peak
   periods when demand is high. Therefore, a decrease in market power
   should lead to convergence between peak and off-peak prices, after
   controlling for different demand and supply conditions as well as the
   change in generation mix due to the expansion of renewable technologies.
   Using daily electricity prices for the 2006-2012 period, we find
   economically and statistically significant convergence effects after the
   settlement of the case. In a richer specification, we show that the
   price reductions appear to be mostly due to the divestiture of gas and
   coal plants, which is consistent with merit-order considerations.
   Additional cross-country analyses support our results. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {Many new energy technologies seem to experience a fall in unit price as
   they mature. In this paper we study the unit price of liquefying natural
   gas in order to make it transportable by ship to gas power installations
   all over the world. Our point of departure is the experience curve
   approach, however unlike many other studies of new energy technologies,
   we also seek to account for autonomous technological change, scale
   effects and the effects of upstream competition among technology
   suppliers. To our surprise we find that upstream competition is by far
   the most important factor contributing to the fall in unit price. With
   respect to the natural gas business, this may have implications for the
   future development in prices as the effect of increased upstream
   competition is temporary and likely to weaken a lot sooner than effects
   from learning and technological change. Another more general policy
   implication, is that while promoting new energy technologies,
   governments must not forget to pay attention to competition policy. (c)

Abstract = {A well-functioning intellectual property (IP) regime plays an important
   role when the country pursuits innovation and low-carbon society as
   well. Though such a proposal can be applied to any nation or society,
   China provides an excellent experiment for the emerging economy
   countries in the transforming society. A series of IP litigations
   between the Chinese company SINOVEL and the U.S Company American
   Superconductor in terms of clean energy technologies (CETs) trade raise
   the contemporary debates over IP and climate change. Based on the
   empirical study and data evidence, this paper explores the
   characteristics and trends of IP litigations in Chinese CET market.
   Within the litigations, the multinational enterprises are the main
   players; and as a package strategy, the legal actions cover patent,
   copyright and trademark, commercial secret, with remedies and
   injunctions. However, antitrust has not become the main strategy against
   IP abuse in Chinese CETs market. And forum shopping is challenging
   Chinese judicial system when CETs industry blooms in the emerging
   country. This paper argues the IP maximalist trend among some developed
   countries and the functions of IP in CETs industry should not only focus
   on trade but also need to have the social and environmental concerns in
   the content of climate change. It is therefore suggested that the
   function of IP should primarily promote technology transfer. It is
   further suggested that the overemphasis on IPRs not innovation may
   potentially undermine not only the dissemination of CETs but also impair
   the effect of climate change mitigation globally.},

Title = {Evolution of price policy for offshore wind energy in China: Trilemma of
   capacity, price and subsidy},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {136},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {China promotes the development of the offshore wind industry to reduce
   CO2 emissions, tackle air pollution, commit to the Paris Climate
   Agreement and develop a strategic emerging industry. The installed
   capacity of offshore wind power in China reached 4445 MW in 2018 which
   was ranked third in the world. Big developers dominated the offshore
   wind energy market with domestic turbines. Many projects are under
   construction. The offshore wind industry in China has experienced four
   stages of price policy: demonstration, concession, feed-in tariff and
   market-oriented competition policy. Nevertheless, it is impossible to
   expand the installed capacity, lower the on-grid price (cost) and reduce
   the subsidy for the offshore wind power industry at the same time. This
   is the trilemma (impossible trinity) that needs to be addressed by the
   price policy. In the past decade, China has implemented an evolving
   price policy, i.e., a system and mechanism that encourage firms to
   invest in the offshore wind industry to expand the capacity of the
   industry by setting price and providing subsidy and other benefits. An
   overall evaluation based on the indicators of installed capacity, price,
   subsidy, spatial distribution, technology and industrial linkage shows
   that the price policy has been effective in balancing capacity, price
   and subsidy up to now. However, lowering the price and reducing the
   subsidy will be the major challenges that China has to overcome in the
   coming years in order to sustain its current growth trend. To boost the
   development of its offshore wind industry further, China needs to
   implement a market-oriented competition price policy and mechanism,
   learn from the experience of price policy evolution in European
   countries and open the market to foreign investors.},

Title = {THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE EU'S CLIMATE CHANGE OBJECTIVES AND ITS STATE
   AID REGULATION IN THE AREA OF RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Journal = {CROATIAN YEARBOOK OF EUROPEAN LAW \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {319-354},
Abstract = {This paper analyses the interaction between the EU's climate change
   objectives and its state aid regulation in the area of renewable energy
   through the chronology of the adoption of the EU's key policy documents
   and related legislation. The EU's state aid rules impose certain
   restrictions on the public financing of renewable energy, which is
   crucial for reaching the EU's climate change objectives in due time. The
   paper identifies four challenges in this respect. The ultimate challenge
   for the EU is how to reconcile science, the market economy and energy
   politics. Another challenge for the EU was the diverging national energy
   policies before the `energy title' was introduced in the Lisbon Treaty.
   The third challenge for the Commission is how to move the climate change
   issues up to the top decision-making level. The final challenge is the
   state aid framework that supports climate change mitigation, whose
   upcoming changes should address the gap between ambition and reality.
   The paper aims to assess the policy consistency of the EU's climate
   change legislation in order to determine whether the EU's credibility as
   a `green leader' is just nominal. The notion of `nominal green leader'
   is related to the consistency of the EU's climate change legislation
   which seems not to have had the expected effect determined by the Kyoto
   Protocol and Paris Agreement. The paper brings the ambitious policies
   face to face with the data on state aid provided for climate and energy
   targets and compares them with the technological expectations in
   renewable energy deployment. The question that arises is whether it is
   time for the EU to balance the understanding of `common interest' more
   towards climate change mitigation at the expense of certain elements of
   competition policy.},

Abstract = {Environmental concerns have played a key role for institutionalizing
   energy policy at the level of the European Union. There is thus a
   tendency in research literature to assume that the objectives of these
   cognate policy areas are compatible and mutually reinforcing. There have
   been only few efforts, however, to critically assess the quality of this
   relationship. The contributions to this mini-special issue reveal that
   the instruments employed in these two policy fields are markedly
   different. Environmental policy instruments are mostly based on the
   command-and-control logic whereas environment-related European energy
   policy is characterized by the use of `softer' measures. The second main
   finding is that despite the centrality of climate change concerns in the
   rhetoric of the European Commission, an effective integration of
   environmental goals into energy policy is difficult to achieve.},

Abstract = {Due to the strategic nature of the energy sector, legal solutions to
   protect cross-border electricity and gas connections will be of
   particular importance. The author realizes that at the present stage of
   development, the cross-border impact may also be manifested by
   generating units (e.g., wind farms) or even end users themselves. The
   lack of harmonized regulations in this area may not only lead to
   limitations in the physical supply of electricity and gas, but also
   affect future investment decisions regarding, for example, new
   generation capacities. In a broader aspect, it will delay, and in the
   extreme case prevent, the achievement of the objectives resulting from
   the EU energy policy, in particular integration within the single energy
   market. In this article, the author identifies devices and entities
   responsible for energy infrastructure that should be classified as
   necessary for the functioning of the single energy market. The research
   includes the analysis and evaluation of regulations governing
   cybersecurity in the energy sector, taking into account the
   interdependencies within, intersectoral and cross-border. In addition,
   the author refers to the need to introduce individual legal solutions
   regarding the protection of energy infrastructure.},

Abstract = {Given the importance of coal in world energy supply an analysis of the
   relevant geographic market is essential for consumers, producers, as
   well as for competition policy. The purpose of this paper is to define
   the relevant economic market for steam and coking coal, and to test the
   hypothesis of single world markets for these coal products.
   Methodologically the paper relies on two different tests for defining
   markets, using both shipments data and price data. The results from both
   methods point in the same direction. In the case of coking coal the
   results indicate that the market is essentially global in scope, and
   also that the market has become more integrated over time. The results
   for steam coal show that the market is more regional in scope, and there
   exist no clear tendencies of increased integration over time. One policy
   implication of the finding that the steam coal market is more regional
   in scope, and thus that the market boundary is smaller than if the
   market would have been international, is that a merger and acquisition
   in this market likely would have been of a more concern for antitrust
   authorities than the same activity on the coking coal market. (c) 2004

Abstract = {We examine the role played by imperfect competition in the response of
   markups to energy price and monetary changes. We find: (i) for
   concentrated industries, markups increase with monetary expansion and
   decrease when energy prices increase; the elasticity with respect to
   energy prices is greater than monetary changes; (ii) for low
   concentration industries, markups are virtually unaffected by monetary
   changes and the energy price elasticities are statistically
   insignificant; (iii) markups are procyclical over the industry-specific
   cycle; and (iv) increased import competition lowers markups only in the
   concentrated industries. The energy price increases (decreases) during
   the 1970s (1980s) may have been a key factor contributing to the
   narrowing (widening) of the markup gap between high and low
   concentration industries. We provide evidence that procyclical markups
   in concentrated industries are not being driven by differences in the
   degree of labor hoarding between low and high concentration industries.

Abstract = {The legal framework of a European energy policy is attached rather
   different weights in the individual member countries of the European
   Union (EU). Consensus has only been achieved about the need to uphold
   four objectives: Energy supply is to be reasonably priced and
   internationally competitive, respectively; it is to guarantee continuity
   and is to be reliable, respectively; also environmental compatibility is
   an important aspect; in the long nln, resource conservation remains an
   important element. It is left open, however, in what way these criteria
   can best be met - which, in concrete terms, means the division of labor
   between the government and the market - and how existing conflicting
   targets can be corrected.
   Because of the pronounced differences in the political and legal
   framework of national energy economies in the EU the objective should
   not so much be a common energy policy planned down to the minutest
   detail, but rather a coordination of national measures of energy policy.
   First of all, the different energy markets should be arranged along the
   lines of market economy and competition, with all companies enjoying
   equal competitive opportunities in the single European market. However,
   this does not require a separate chapter on energy in the European
   treaties.
   The supply of energy fulfills an important basic function in modem
   economies in that it enhances productivity and competitiveness. It is
   for this reason, undoubtedly, that the supply of energy is a matter of
   special public interest. However this is no justification for its being
   considered a duty Of the government. The public interest is protected
   best by the government establishing a framework and supervising the
   supply of energy by private industries. In this arrangement, any mixup
   of entrepreneurial commitment and government supervision must be avoided
   as much as possible.
   There are other problems of harmonization in Brussels, besides the
   conflicts in competition policy in the field of energy supply through
   transmission lines and pipelines - i.e. the halting liberalization of
   national electricity and gas markets in the Community. On the one hand,
   the concept of a carbon dioxide energy tax for carbon-intensive
   economies is associated with grave handicaps for an industrialized
   country. On the other hand, discussions go on within the EU about
   requiring certain types of planning and evaluation for public energy
   supply. Least Cost Planning is the new magic formula which is to become
   the guiding principle. However, it would be going too far if a
   combination of least costs for supply and demand side factors were
   imposed by the administration.
   Industries must know where they stand; basic data must be provided by
   Brussels and by Bonn so that they are calculable on a long term basis.
   Ar the same time, investments must be authorized more quickly.
   Especially in Germany licensing procedures have become far too lengthy
   in recent years.
   In addition, political investment ruins are created because specific
   sources of energy are abandoned more or less abruptly for political
   reasons. As soon as a crisis of acceptance develops into rejection,
   investments are bound to stagnate for a long time. The guiding principle
   should be confidence in the market, especially in the energy economy. At
   the present time, the mood in the German power industry is worse than
   the economic situation. The European perspective offers opportunities
   which could provoke a more optimistic view of the future also in this
   country.},

   EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF LEGAL AND OWNERSHIP UNBUNDLING},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Competition and antitrust law aims to prevent companies from engaging in
   anti-competitive behavior and to promote and protect market competition.
   In this context, mergers and acquisitions (M\&As) are under particular
   scrutiny, since they are often assumed to be motivated by possible
   market power increases, thus adversely affecting market efficiency. With
   a view to recent efforts within the European Union to increase the
   effectiveness of competition law in the energy sector (that is, legal
   and ownership unbundling as policy tools geared towards forcing
   corporations into demerging transactions), an event study approach is
   applied in this article to evaluate the market response to the
   announcement of mergers and acquisitions in EU and U.S. energy markets
   and to determine whether or not the hypothesis that M\&As result in
   increased market power of the joined companies actually holds true.
   Findings indicate that increases in market power are not the main motive
   for energy market M\&As. The results thus oppose the general adequacy of
   legal and ownership unbundling as veritable competition law instruments
   against market imperfections and failures, but indicate that unbundling
   can indeed be a viable policy solution if implemented on a case-by-case
   basis.},

Abstract = {The paper provides an overview of the generation of electricity in 10
   countries in South East Europe during 1995-2004. Using the latest
   available statistics, we explore the potential of the nascent
   integration of the electricity markets in South East Europe. We conduct
   a cross-country analysis of electricity production based on different
   types of fuel used. The region has a low level of gasification combined
   with few nuclear power generation facilities, while some countries
   heavily rely on hydro electric generation. Differences in countries'
   resource endowment and the possibility of intertemporal substitution
   between electricity generated from various fuels could stimulate a
   regional trade in electricity. As an alternative to nationally
   independent energy policy, regional trade could displace a proportion of
   the substantial investment in generation facilities required to avert
   serious supply shortages. Finally, we consider the environmental impact
   of electricity generation, and identify some of the key trade-offs
   between different policy objectives. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {As part of the 4th antitrust novella, the German legislator regulated
   the maximum duration of concession agreements for companies operating
   electricity and gas networks. As a consequence, a large portion of the
   20,000 existing, concession agreements are currently about to expire.
   Local municipalities are expected to decide whether or not to call for
   offers from operating companies to acquire concessions for existing
   distribution networks. A central issue in this case is the determination
   of a ``fair{''} purchase price for the distribution network. This paper
   examines the impact of different legal form interpretations on the
   valuation methods used for energy networks. In this context, we analyse
   under which circumstances the valuation concept of the objectified
   capitalized earnings value may be substituted by more adequate valuation
   methods. In particular, a modification of the valuation perspective and
   the consideration of acquirer-specific synergies are discussed.},

Pages = {125-154},
Abstract = {Integrating national markets is a major policy target in the European
   energy market. Yet, wholesale prices for electricity still differ
   significantly. Whether these price differences are caused only by
   limited interconnector capacities or also by lack of cross-border
   competition is an open question. To address this question, we develop a
   new approach to determine to which extent price differences stem from
   limited participation in cross-border trade. We derive a theoretical
   integration benchmark, using Grossman's (1976) notion of a rational
   expectations equilibrium. We compare the benchmark to data from European
   electricity markets. The data reject the integration hypothesis and
   indicate that well informed traders do not engage in cross-border trade.},

Title = {State Created Barriers to Exit: The Example of the Acquisition of Alstom
   by General Electric},
Journal = {COMPETITION POLICY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {96-111},
Month = {SPR-FAL},
Abstract = {This paper seeks to understand the competitive impact of State
   restrictions to M\&A transactions that target domestic corporations. In
   the economic literature, a rich body of papers has examined the impact
   of State restrictions in terms of market access, international trade and
   FDI. In contrast, the consequences of State restrictions in terms of
   economic competition remain poorly understood. To discuss the
   competitive effects of State restrictions to M\&A transactions that
   target domestic firms, the present paper offers a case study of the
   takeover of the French company Alstom by the U.S. conglomerate General
   Electric ({''}GE{''}) in 2014, and of the measures adopted by the French
   Government to undermine it. This case is interesting. Unlike in the
   conventional scenario where Government intervention leads to prohibit
   the transaction, the Government interference did not kill the GE/Alstom
   transaction. Rather, in GE/Alstom, the French Government re-engineered
   the initial transaction. In lieu of an ``absorption{''} of Alstom by GE
   as initially envisioned, the parties were forced to seal an
   ``alliance.{''} Our case-study shows that State interference may
   influence the competitive conditions in the market. In particular, we
   advance a counterintuitive idea. While the traditional market access
   literature would lead to envision State interference as a form of
   measure that protects the domestic firm, we show that State interference
   can also harm the domestic firm. In particular, in the case in point,
   the French Government measures may have locked Alstom behind exit
   barriers, by preventing it to leave the energy markets it purported to
   quit. We review empirical data to test our hypothesis. In practical
   terms, we believe our findings are interesting, because the literature
   on failed industrial projects suggests that Governments are often bad at
   making exit choices. This should be kept in mind, at a time where
   proponents of strong industrial policy agendas are increasingly vocal.
   Moreover, our analysis may have implications for antitrust policy. As
   much as entry barriers, barriers to exit prevent the emergence of
   competitive markets and are thus a concern for antitrust agencies.
   Additionally, State interference with M\&A risk undermining the efficacy
   of merger control systems, in depriving antitrust agencies' ability to

Title = {THE ANTITRUST TREATMENT OF ELECTRICITY MARKET OF UKRAINE: CONUNDRUM WITH
   THE CONCEPT OF COLLECTIVE DOMINANCE AND EU EXPERIENCE},

Abstract = {The main purpose of the article is to provide comparison research of
   collective dominance doctrine and practice in the EU and the enforcement
   practice in Ukraine. Methodology. The paper focused on the compliance of
   AMCU's analysis of national electricity market in Ukraine with the
   European law enforcement practice that arises from the international
   legal obligations of Ukraine to use in its practice the EU competition
   rules according to Article 18 of the Treaty establishing the Energy
   Community and taking into account the criteria of interpretation in
   accordance with the EU case law. Article 255 of the Association
   Agreement between Ukraine and the EU that clearly provides the principle
   of transparency, non-discrimination, and neutrality in compliance with
   the procedures of the procedural justice and the right of defence also
   indicates a special actuality of the carried-out research in this field.
   The main practical impact of such research is to implement not only
   substantial norms of the EU Competition law but its enforcement practice
   \& to introduce it within the practice of AMCU. Value/originality. The
   paper examines a dominance doctrine, market power definition, economic
   strength, and collective dominance practice in the EU enforcement
   practice. A special attention was paid to enforcement practice in the
   electricity market. Due to the fact that the investigation of Ukrainian
   electricity market was provided for the first time in Ukraine, there is
   no practice yet in this issue. This causes the necessity of wide
   comparative approach in the principles of collective dominance in the
   electricity market in Ukraine. Results. The paper finds that the AMCU's
   approach to electricity market regulation in Ukraine confirms the
   necessity to reform the system of the governmental regulation in the
   wholesale electricity market and in the market of services for
   electricity transmission, necessity for the change of the system for
   tariff and pricing policy formation on the part of the National Energy
   and Utilities Regulatory Commission of Ukraine and the Ministry of
   Energy and Coal-Mining Industry of Ukraine for developing the
   competition in electricity market and the need to follow the approaches
   and criteria of the EU competition law with regard to determination of
   the dominance in the market, which is stipulated by the international
   legal obligations of Ukraine arising from Articles 18 and 94 of the
   Treaty establishing the Energy Community and Art. 255 of the EU-Ukraine
   Association Agreement.},

Abstract = {The New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) in England and Wales are
   just over one year old and are generally acknowledged to have
   successfully enabled competitive pressures to emerge fully in the
   generation market for the first time since the electricity industry was
   liberalised in 1990. With their emphasis on treating electricity as far
   as possible like any other tradable commodity and their lack of a
   centralized, clearing market, they represent a radical departure from
   conventional wholesale trading arrangements. This article explains the
   principles underlying NETA and examines how the arrangements have fared
   over their first year.},

Journal = {ENERGY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may grant market-based rates to
   oil pipelines in the U.S. upon a showing that they lack market power.
   The Commission defines market power as the ability to profitably
   increase price above the competitive level for a significant period.
   Because comparing tariffs alone is generally meaningless for identifying
   good transportation alternatives, the Commission tends to rely on
   netback price and delivered price analyses to evaluate market power.
   When the applicant's tariff is a poor proxy for the competitive tariff,
   as evidenced by significant excess demand, using the tariff biases the
   analysis in favor of finding market power, a reverse cellophane trap.
   Estimating the competitive tariff to avoid this bias is complicated by
   the spatial aspect of transportation. This paper suggests several ways
   to estimate the competitive tariff based on netback and delivered
   prices, or based on estimated cost, and provides an example. Published

Title = {Market Structure of Urban Waste Treatment and Disposal: Empirical
   Evidence from the Italian Industry},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In light of the organizational dynamics of services of economic
   interest, the regulation of municipal solid waste management is a
   critical issue to deal with so as to achieve sustainability goals in the
   coming decades. The European circular economy targets limit the share of
   municipal waste in landfills to a maximum of 10\% by 2035. Consequently,
   waste-to-energy plants may temporarily become the primary option for
   residual unsorted waste. The municipal waste management chain comprises
   two consequential stages: collection and transport, and the treatment
   and disposal stage, which characterizes as an oligopolistic market
   structure. After defining the relevant market and calculating market
   concentration measures, we analyze market power in the treatment and
   disposal of non-recyclable mixed waste, also known as residual waste.
   Our analyses are based on empirical data using well-known market
   concentration indices such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman index and
   concentration ratios. We report the results of three different market
   concentration scenarios based on alternative geographic and product
   market definitions. Considering only waste-to-energy as a product
   market, we present a situation of moderate concentration, typically
   involving the attention of competition authorities. On the contrary,
   considering both options as a single product market, no relevant
   evidence emerges due to the significant share of waste sent to landfills
   in 2019, i.e., 20.1\% of the total municipal solid waste generated in
   Italy. Implications for future studies consist of new detailed
   information on the municipal waste treatment market structure in one of
   the leading European countries that may prompt comparative studies.
   Policy implications are derived from the possibility of taking cues from
   this paper to envisage appropriate regulatory models for an evolving
   sector in which market spaces are increasing.},

Title = {Do classes of gas stations contribute differently to fuel prices?
   Evidence to foster effective competition in Spain},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {139},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Despite the relatively large number of gas stations reached in Spain
   after decades of sectorial reforms, pre-tax fuel prices in the country
   remain systematically among the highest in the EU. The literature
   provides evidence suggesting that a low intensity of competition in the
   retail distribution could contribute to these casual observations. With
   the purpose of shedding light on ways to design effective competition
   measures, we conduct an empirical analysis of more than ten million
   observations containing information about prices, brands, and locations
   at the station level. This allows us to know whether the exit (entry) of
   some classes of stations have the ability to reduce the prices of nearby
   competitors. Our results suggest that the presence in a local market of
   a station belonging to the network of the dominant market companies will
   tend to generate prices above the average. This is not only because
   these stations set higher prices but also because their presence will
   give rise to overpricing by local competitors. The opposite occurs with
   the self-advertised as ``low-cost{''} stations. Policy measures
   promoting the gradual exit of stations associated with the dominant
   companies seem quite reasonable in view of the commitment to the
   transition toward transport decarbonization.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the implications of forward contracting on oligopoly
   environments by extending the model of Allaz and Vila to an environment
   with multiple firms and increasing marginal cost. Estimates of key
   parameters of this model are taken from existing electricity markets to
   predict the market impact of one round of public contracting, such as
   those seen in auctions for retail provision and resource procurement.
   The results imply that, when forward contracts are present, the
   importance of supplier concentration is greatly magnified relative to
   other determinants unilateral market power such as demand elasticity.},

Abstract = {In this paper we revisit the debate on the role of vertical integration
   in the energy sectors: whether vertical integration between coal and
   electricity sectors is a path to create a competitive electricity market
   in China. We discuss coal-power conflict and potential anti-competitive
   concerns related to vertical integration, such as raise rival's cost and
   collusion, and suggest that regulators and policy makers should pay more
   attention to the behavior of integrated companies. In particular, they
   should balance the tradeoff of vertical integration between coal and
   electricity companies and ensure that efficiency gains should offset
   anti-competitive effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   II},

Abstract = {This paper studies the interactions between electricity and carbon
   allowance prices in the year-ahead energy markets of France, Germany,
   United Kingdom and the Nordic countries, during Phase H of the EU ETS.
   VAR and Granger-causality methods are used to analyze causal interfaces,
   whereas the volatility of electricity prices is studied with basic and
   asymmetric AR-GARCH models. Among the main results, the marginal rate at
   which carbon prices feed into electricity prices is shown to be ca.
   135\% in the EEX and Nord Pool markets, where electricity and carbon
   prices display bidirectional causality, and 109\% in the UK. Therefore,
   generators in these markets internalized the cost of freely allotted
   emission allowances into their electricity prices considerably more than
   the proportionate increase in costs justified by effective carbon
   intensity. Moreover, electricity prices in France are found to
   Granger-cause the carbon price. This study also shows how European
   electricity prices are deeply linked to coal prices among other factors,
   both in terms of levels and volatility, regardless of the underlying
   fuel mix, and that coal was marginally more profitable than gas for
   electricity generation. EU policies aimed at increasing the carbon price
   are likely to be crucial in limiting the externalities involved in the
   transition to a low-carbon system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Price coordination in the Spanish oil market: The monday effect},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {149},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Spanish premium oil operators have been accused of coordinating gasoline
   price cuts on Mondays. The objective of this practice, known as the
   ``Monday effect{''} was to lower the official prices of automotive fuels
   - that was collected on Mondays - so as Spain was not at the top of the
   European price ranking. This behavior presumably ceased in May 2013 when
   Government began to consider the average prices of the entire week
   instead of Mondays prices. In order to test whether this anticompetitive
   behavior existed and ceased after the change in the data collection
   methodology, we employ a novel database that includes retail prices for
   all petrol stations in Spain in the period 2012-2013. Using a
   difference-in-difference estimator, we exploit this regulatory change to
   econometrically identify and confirm that: i) the three main companies,
   with 70\% of the market share, have systematically established lower
   prices on Mondays, and that this is unjustified by either cost or
   demand; ii) this price reduction was small during 2012, but increased
   significantly in the first half of 2013. iii) following the change in
   the collection of price data by the government, the average Monday
   effect `disappeared' from the Spanish gasoline market. Our results
   highlight the price coordination capacity of dominant oil operators in
   Spain and suggest that authorities that monitor cartels should be much
   more active in promoting competition in this sector, for example, by
   facilitating the entry of low-cost or independent stations and/or by
   being particularly alert to evidence of collusive behavior. Likewise,
   this coordination capacity must be taken into account when evaluating
   mergers in this sector and/or imposing fines.},

Abstract = {Joint ownership of production plants is a common feature of electricity
   markets in general. E.g., in Sweden the nuclear plants are, in different
   constellations, predominantly owned and controlled by the three largest
   electricity producers; Vattenfall, E.ON and Fortum, i.e., by the three
   major rivals that should be competing vigorously in the electricity
   market. The electricity wholesale market is also an oligopolistic
   market, with relatively inelastic demand, making the market susceptible
   to the exercise of market power. In this paper we elaborate on the
   potential competition problems and associated risks that can arise due
   to the joint ownership of nuclear plants. We conclude that, also without
   actual infringements of the competition rules, there are still major
   competition concerns associated with the joint ownership of production
   facilities among competing firms. Thus, the existing joint ownership
   should be disbanded, or at least as far as possible limited, and any
   similar ownership constellations proposed in the future prohibited.},

Abstract = {We examine allegations that firms in Alberta's electricity industry
   manipulated public information to coordinate in the wholesale market. We
   investigate whether bids by firms who employed unique pricing patterns
   were consistent with unilateral expected profit maximization. Our
   results suggest that these firms could have increased expected profits
   through unilateral deviations. For one firm, the potential to increase
   profits is greater on days when certain offer patterns are observed,
   providing support for the claim that such patterns may have assisted
   coordination on high-priced outcomes. These results suggest that
   regulators should exercise caution when designing information disclosure

Abstract = {This paper refers to the regulation as an instrument of administrative
   intervention in an overview of liberalization of essential utilities,
   especially in the electricity industry. From this perspective, we
   examined the transformation undergone by the state's relationship with
   society, due to the new economic paradigm, which promotes a liberalized
   economy for the electricity supply, regulated by independent agencies
   that intervene in the energy market, without participating in it.
   Finally, we analyse the relationship between the independent energy
   regulator and the antitrust system, with the purpose of achieving the
   suitable functioning of energy markets. The study was done from the
   evolution of the Spanish electricity sector.},

Abstract = {Global warming and other adverse climate change impacts induced by
   anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are a major public policy concern
   around the world including transitional economies. This paper,
   therefore, examines the impacts of market-based economic reforms on per
   capita CO2 emissions in the European and Central Asian transition
   economies where environmental degradation was pervasive prior to these
   reforms. A dynamic panel data model is employed for this purpose for 28
   countries covering 22 years from 1990 to 2012. Our overall results
   suggest that economic openness may not necessarily result in sustainable
   development although reforms in competition policy and corporate
   governance were the significant drivers of emissions reductions in the
   region. Hence, advances in competition policy and governance reforms are
   desirable given the available scope to extend these reforms. The
   structural shift to and emergence of light industries also contributed
   to declining CO2 emissions in the transition process. The direct impact
   of the Kyoto Protocol in reducing emissions is debatable which also
   raises doubts on the effectiveness of the Paris agreements.},

Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},

Volume = {28},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The data described in this article were collected daily over the period
   18 August 2014 to 15 June 2015 from the website of the Spanish Ministry
   of Industry, Energy and Tourism http://geoportalgasolineras.es. The
   database includes information on almost all gas stations located in
   Spain that sell to the public. For each gas station we have information
   of daily diesel prices (both posted price and net of taxes), brands and
   locations latitude and longitude) and the Brent price. We also share a
   Stata program file to identify the nearest competitors of each gas
   station and their brand. The program also computes the distance to the
   nearest refinery and its brand. The data base can be used for analyzing
   firms pricing behavior focusing, for example, on asymmetric pricing,
   cartels or vertical integration, among other topics. This data base is
   used in the paper {[}2] `` Effects of antitrust prosecution on retail
   fuel prices{''} that analyze the impact on prices of an antitrust
   sanction imposed to several brands on February 2015. (C) 2019 The

Title = {Offer Price Information and the Exercise of Market Power: The Effect of
   the Publication of the Historical Trading Report on Competition in the
   Alberta Electricity Market},
Journal = {ENERGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {141-166},
Abstract = {This paper considers the effect of the publication of offer price
   information on unilateral market power in Alberta's electricity market.
   This market is an hourly auction characterized by repeated interaction
   among a small number of producers, common knowledge of costs and
   production capabilities, and price inelastic demand.
   For the period July 13, 2000 to May 18, 2017, offer prices for each hour
   were published by the market operator, the Alberta Electric System
   Operator (AESO), in the Historical Trading Report (HTR) after the end of
   the hour. Using counterfactual analysis from 2010 to 2015 (52.584
   hours), the paper finds that the effect of offer price changes after the
   HTR publication was to raise the average hourly price for electricity in
   Alberta by \$2.48/MWh or about 4.2\%, which raised the cost of
   electricity for Alberta consumers during the six-year period by
   approximately \$1.14 billion.
   Based on an earlier version of this paper, the AESO was instructed by
   Alberta's utilities regulator to cease publication of the HTR.},

Abstract = {This article identifies areas of agreement and disagreement among
   Mexican economists in relation to key issues of economics, on the basis
   of a survey of 360 members of the profession. The propositions eliciting
   the greatest consensus included: equity in income distribution, vigorous
   use of antitrust and consumer protection laws and the use of
   countercyclical fiscal policies. The most contentious issues were:
   private investment in the energy sector, the determinants of inflation,
   the minimum wage as a cause of unemployment and the objectives to be
   pursued by an independent central bank.},

Abstract = {We study the impact of electricity divestments of intermediate size in a
   stylised model where a dominant producer faces a competitive fringe with
   the same cost structure and is forced to sell some of its capacity. We
   find that the divestment which achieves the greatest reduction in prices
   can be several times more effective in reducing prices than a divestment
   of baseload (or low-cost) plants. We also compare divestments of
   intermediate size and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), establishing that
   VPPs are significantly less effective than the optimal divestment.},

Abstract = {Efficiency in the management of electricity transmission networks is
   essential for the success of the liberalized energy markets. The paper
   is dedicated to the short-run management problems of these natural
   monopolies. It analyses how to organize and price access to and use of
   the transport network. After presenting the technical and institutional
   features of the electricity industry, the paper develops the normative
   approach of first-best and second-best pricing by means of nodal prices.
   Then the exercise of market power at some nodes and its consequences for
   the transport system operator are examined. The remaining part is more
   policy oriented, describing and analysing the practical solutions
   implemented in the European Union for energy transport pricing. The
   paper concludes with some remarks about the enforcement of antitrust
   rules in electricity transport.},

Title = {Assessment of feedstocks for biogas production, part I-A multi-criteria
   approach},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},

Volume = {122},
Pages = {373-387},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Expansion of biogas production is dependent on the availability of
   suitable feedstocks (biomass). What feedstock is suitable is a question
   that can be tackled from many different perspectives it is a
   multidimensional problem. Therefore, a multi-criteria method has been
   developed that can be used to assess the suitability of feedstock for
   biogas and biofertilizer production. The method covers aspects of
   resource efficiency and feasibility, and the potential to supply
   renewable energy and recycle nutrients, operationalized via 16
   indicators directed towards cost efficiency, technological feasibility,
   energy and environmental performance, accessibility, competition, policy
   and other issues. Thus it is relatively comprehensive method, yet simple
   enough to be used by practitioners. The main ambition, applying the
   method, has been to collect and structure relevant information to
   facilitate strategic overviews, communication and informed decision
   making. This is relevant for development within the biogas and
   biofertilizer industry, to define and prioritize among essential
   research projects, regarding policy, etc. This article, the first of two
   associated articles, is focused on the method itself. For illustration,
   the method is applied to assess the suitability of producing biogas from
   ``stickleback{''}, which is a non-edible fish in the Baltic Sea region.
   In the companion article (Part II), four other feedstocks are assessed
   in detail, namely ley crops, straw, farmed blue mussels, and
   source-sorted food waste. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A U.S. economist and senior Russian government official examine the
   history of efforts to reform natural monopolies in the Russian
   Federation, focusing on changes occurring after March 1991. Initial
   sections explore the evolution of competition policy and pricing and
   examine provisions of extant natural monopoly legislation in Russia.
   Coverage than turns to developments in the four key sectors of
   electrical energy, natural gas, railroads, and telecommunications. A
   concluding section addresses whether prospects for competition have
   improved, identifies barriers to reform, and outlines common features of
   natural monopolies in post-Soviet Russia and how they differ from those
   in capitalist economies.},

Abstract = {Recent events, such as the California energy crisis, the failures of the
   UK's railways, and the consequences of the third-generation (3G) mobile
   licence auctions, have called into question the European reliance on a
   strategy of network industry, liberalization. Substantial concentration
   in energy and telecoms markets has also raised the issue of the
   consistency of competition policy with the creation of internal energy
   and communications markets. The paper considers the multiple market
   failures in these industries, and the problems raised by a series of
   national policy approaches which fail fully to reflect the economies of
   scale and scope and the European-level public goods. Security, of supply
   in energy, the roll-out of broadband, and the gains for an overarching
   approach to climate change require a more European focus. This in turn
   will require institutional reform at the European level. Failure to
   address this Europe-wide agenda will leave Europe behind the USA.},

Abstract = {The supply function equilibrium provides a game-theoretic model of
   strategic bidding in oligopolistic wholesale electricity auctions. This
   paper presents an intuitive account of current understanding and shows
   how welfare losses depend on the number of firms in the market and their
   asymmetry. Previous results and general recommendations for
   divisible-good/multi-unit auctions provides guidance on the design of
   the auction format, setting the reservation price, the rationing rule,
   and restrictions on the offer curves in wholesale electricity auctions.

Abstract = {Regulation of natural monopolies implies strict adherence to the
   legislation that does not take into account the variety of circumstances
   of activities and the possible transactions organization options. The
   litigation between the ``Rosneft{''} and ``Sakhalin Energy{''} companies
   about the access to the gas pipeline, which connects the gas field in
   the North of the Sakhalin Island with the liquefied natural gas (LNG)
   plant in the Southern part of the Island, is analyzed. It is shown that
   consideration of a broader range of institutional alternatives of the
   gas transportation organization through an insulated pipeline is
   necessary. The basis of the regulator decisions is the existence of
   market for gas transportation services, which in fact is not (and should
   not be) the default option. An approach to such situations analysis is
   proposed, it allows covering a wide range of institutional alternatives
   that could provide a higher level of social welfare. The Grossman-Hart
   model of incomplete contracts and its verification on real data is used
   for the demonstration that a simple decision to allow an isolated
   pipeline access, when the participants of the transaction are
   independent, can lead to a decrease of the public welfare, compared with
   alternatives involving integration.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze variations in the degree
   of persistence of profitability across diverse economic sectors and
   industry groups over the time period of 1990-2014 for a sample of top
   publically listed firms belonging to a selected set of developed and
   developing economies. Design/methodology/approach Degree of profit
   persistence has been estimated using Mueller's (1990) autoregressive
   methodology. Firms were classified into different economic sectors and
   industry groups as per the Global Industry Classification Standard
   (GICS). The examination of inter-sectoral variations in profit
   persistence has been performed by comparing mean values of estimated
   short-run and long-run profit persistence parameter for all firms and
   between firms belonging to the developed and developing countries,
   respectively. Findings Firms in consumer staples, consumer discretionary
   and health care enjoy persistent above the norm returns, unlike firms in
   traditional industries, utilities and energy sectors, which are
   characterized by low persistence and below the norm returns. A high
   degree of profit persistence is observed in health care and idea- and
   technology-intensive sector in the developed countries; however, in the
   developing countries, profits persist higher in consumer discretionary
   and capital-intensive telecommunication services sectors.
   Originality/value The study provides a holistic examination of
   inter-sectoral variations in profit persistence of top firms in
   developed and developing economies using a uniform methodology and data
   set. It can serve as an aid to the competition commissions and
   anti-trust regulatory authorities to formulate policies for curtailing
   anti-competitive activities in certain sectors.},

Journal = {ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {390-399},
Abstract = {This article investigates the history of mergers and acquisitions in
   global offshore drilling markets from 1990 to 2005. Based on this
   history, the effect of increasing market concentration on prices is
   examined using regression analysis. Industry concentration is measured
   by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. Two segments of the global drilling
   rig market are examined: jackups and semisubmersibles. The results of
   this initial investigation provide evidence to support the conclusion
   that increased market concentration in the jackup drilling rig market
   has resulted in increased prices; the evidence is weaker for the
   semisubmersible drilling rig market, but there appears to be a positive
   impact in this sector also. These results provide insight into the
   industrial organization of an important exploration and production input
   market, and provide information to antitrust regulators who are charged
   with maintaining competitive markets. Future analysis is anticipated to
   investigate and control for more subtle aspects of market structure, and
   to specify additional econometric models.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to build and empirically evaluate a discrete choice
   model of merger remedies as a basis for policy analysis. The database
   consists of 229 merger cases accepted in Phase I or Phase II of the
   European merger process between 1990 and 2005. We focus on the following
   question: Which merging firms' characteristics lead the European
   Commission to decide whether to require conditional acceptance? Although
   a lot of empirical studies have been carried out these last years, ours
   is distinguished by at least two original features. First, we explore
   determinant factors of the Commission's decisions with a neural network
   model differentiating cases accepted with or without remedies ( either
   structural or behavioral). Secondly, we implement three multinomial
   logit models. We find that variables related to high market power lead
   more frequently to a remedy outcome, no matter the phase. Innovative
   industries such as energy, transportation and communications positively
   affect the probability of a behavioral remedy. Lastly, former
   Competition Commissioner Mario Monti's policy appears to be pro-remedy,
   i.e. seeking concessions from merging parties.},

Abstract = {The Korean government has allowed the introduction of independent power
   producers (IPPs), Private firms were invited to build and operate two
   500 MW bituminous coal plants and two 400 MW LNG plants, Although the
   stated rationale for introducing IPPs is raising efficiency through
   competition, the real forces that drive such a policy are the necessity
   to secure enough funds from the private sector to raise the generating
   capacity of the country and the need to resolve siting issues, The
   participating firms have to carefully review various legal factors such
   as laws governing the electrical power business, antitrust regulations
   which include the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act and credit
   control by the central bank, and tax laws, For the successful adoption
   of IPPs appropriate institutional changes should also be made. In terms
   of regulatory issues, alternative methods of rate regulation need to be
   considered, In addition, the changing business environment requires
   careful analysis and modification of the current regulatory framework to
   keep pace with the rapid transition in industry size and structure. (C)

   the market-power distortion, the planner's optimal policy is
   second-best. The main insight is that optimal carbon prices may be
   highly asymmetric: zero in some countries and above the social cost of
   carbon in countries with relatively dirty production. This result
   obtains even though a uniform global carbon price is always successful
   at reducing countries' emissions. Competition policy that mitigates
   market power may enable stronger climate action.},

Abstract = {In an experiment on markets for services, we find that consumers are
   likely to stick to default tariffs and achieve suboptimal outcomes. We
   find that inattention to the task of choosing a better tariff is likely
   to be a substantial problem in addition to any task and tariff
   complexity effect. The institutional setup on which we primarily model
   our experiment is the UK electricity and gas markets, and our conclusion
   is that the new measures by the UK regulator Ofgem to improve consumer
   outcomes are likely to be of limited impact.},

Abstract = {A major challenge for designers of competitive electricity markets is to
   devise market rules that limit the capability of electricity producers
   to exercise market power. Market power is the ability of a firm owning
   generation assets to raise the market price by its bidding behavior and
   to profit from this price increase. In addition, an important plan of
   market monitoring units in long term and competition policy framework is
   to persuade the participants to bid prices near to their marginal costs.
   Therefore, estimation of marginal cost function is important in way that
   Regulatory use it to increase competition in electricity markets. Bid
   price of the power plant to the power market contains some important
   information that can lead to more exact estimation of their marginal
   cost.
   In this paper the marginal cost of a typical power plant is estimated
   using optimal bidding behavior model in a competitive electricity market
   and Iran power market data.},

Title = {The Virtue of Common Ownership in an Era of Corporate Compliance},
Journal = {IOWA LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {105},
Number = {2},
Pages = {507-573},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent years have seen a tremendous rise in common ownership, a
   structure in which large institutional investors have significant
   holdings in corporations that are horizontal competitors. Common
   ownership has long been the topic of scholarly debate with many scholars
   traditionally arguing that common ownership presents antitrust problems.
   Rather than enter into the antitrust debate, this Article argues that
   common ownership presents great virtue for corporate governance, and
   more specifically-corporate compliance.
   In recent years the Department of Justice and other enforcement
   authorities have increasingly directed their resources towards enforcing
   laws that are typically oriented towards specific industries, such as
   healthcare (pharmaceuticals), financial and energy industries, or
   geographic areas. These laws-including the Foreign Corruption Practices
   Act, False Claims Act, Bank Secrecy Act, as well as laws and regulations
   aimed at preventing money laundering, environmental, and antitrust
   violations-expose companies associated with specific industries to heavy
   legal risks-which I term ``macro legal risks.{''}
   This Article argues that institutional investors who hold shares in
   corporations in line with the common ownership structure are uniquely
   positioned to enhance the compliance of those corporations with
   industry-oriented laws, and to minimize exposure to macro legal risks.
   Institutional investors who invest in corporations that operate in the
   same industry can take advantage of three interrelated merits of common
   ownership: (1) enhanced incentives for monitoring compliance of
   corporations with industry-oriented laws, which accordingly leads to
   minimizing macro legal risks; (2) privileged access to rulemaking and
   lawmaking; and (3) experimental learning of macro legal risks. These
   merits allow institutional investors to better monitor corporations in
   which they invest and practice effective corporate governance and
   compliance.
   The incentives of institutional investors increase due to increased
   aggregate exposure to problems affecting a certain industry. The
   difficulty of responding to these problems decreases as institutional
   investors are able to apply a one-size-fits-all approach to these
   problems, rather than develop individualized solutions for specific
   corporations. Due to their status as major asset holders, institutional
   investors develop close relationships with regulators and lawmakers,
   giving them a chance to influence regulation beyond the normal notice
   and comment process and anticipate trends in law and regulation.
   Finally, as a result of their wide holdings, institutional investors can
   apply knowledge gained in investigations and enforcement proceedings
   against a corporation to prevent these from happening to other
   corporations within the industry.
   This Article is the first to analyze the benefits of common ownership in
   the area of corporate compliance. It argues that in an era of increasing
   enforcement based on industry-oriented characteristics, institutional
   investors who invest in line with a common ownership structure will
   become more active in overseeing corporate compliance and more effective
   in minimizing corporate wrongdoing.},

Abstract = {We examine the role of information transparency in Alberta's wholesale
   electricity market. Using data on firms' bidding behavior, we analyze
   whether firms utilize information revealed in near real-time through the
   Historical Trading Report (HTR), which is released 10min after each hour
   and contains a complete (de-identified) list of every firms' bids into
   the wholesale market from the previous hour. We demonstrate that firms
   are often able to identify the offers of specific rivals by offer
   patterns adopted by those firms. For one of these firms, these patterns
   are associated with higher offer prices. This is consistent with
   allegations by Alberta's Market Surveillance Administrator that firms
   may be utilizing unique bidding patterns to reveal their identities to
   their rivals to elevate market prices. We show that certain firms
   respond to rival offer changes with a lag consistent with responding to
   information revealed through the HTR, and that they respond differently
   to different firms, suggesting that they are able to infer
   identification.},

Volume = {62},

Abstract = {We study the role of communication in collusive market sharing. In a
   series of Cournot oligopoly experiments with multiple markets, we vary
   the information that firms can exchange: hard information-verifiable
   information about past conduct-and soft information-unbinding
   information about future conduct. We find that the effect of
   communication on the firms' ability to collude depends on the type of
   information available: Whereas market prices increase only slightly with
   hard information, the price raise due to soft information is
   substantial. Our results point to the types and contents of
   communication that should be of particular concern to antitrust
   authorities.},

Journal = {ENERGY JOURNAL},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1-15},
Abstract = {This paper examines parallels between the evolution of spot markets for
   oil during the 1980s, particularly Brent, and what is now happening in
   the UK gas industry. The structure of supply, formerly within the
   control of British Gas, is breaking up under antitrust and regulatory
   pressures, and the short-term balancing needs of the system are being
   externalised. This is giving rise to a spot market. This paper
   identifies four stages in the development of a spot market, of which the
   UK market is presently in the first and second stages (physical
   balancing and the development of price transparency). Feedback effects
   on prices are already apparent, and the fourth stage, the development of
   risk management tools, is being discussed. This scenario was drawn up
   three years ago, based upon the experience of oil before the existence
   of a gas spot market was acknowledged. It has so far not missed a step.
   According to this analysis, the question over the extension of this
   logic to the gas markets in Continental Europe is not whether, but when?},

Abstract = {Turkish electricity reform has progressed slowly due to internal
   resistance against privatisation, and gained momentum after Electricity
   Market Law of 2001, prepared in line with EU Energy Acquis and
   established required institutional and legal framework. Although the
   eligibility threshold has reached 39\% market opening rate, the dominant
   position of public both as owner and decision-maker is still the major
   problem in the sector. Currently Turkey is self-sufficient in
   electricity, but likely to face shortages in 10 years if the growing
   demand is not met by either speeding the liberalisation process, or
   joining the South East Europe Electricity Market. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Entry by vertical integration to defeat monopolization has played an
   important role in several antitrust cases. Yet the source of financing
   for such entry is unclear, given that the entrant represents a public
   good to the vertically related firms. While there are a number of
   theoretical and experimental studies on the private supply of a public
   good, there is little empirical estimation on this topic. This paper
   examis business contributions to the creation of Broadcast Music, Inc.
   (BMI) in 1940. BMI was created by broadcasters specifically to fight
   monopolization, and represented investment in a pure public good. This
   study finds that several factors led to contributions to create BMI. In
   particular, network affiliation increased the probability that a station
   would join BMI. There is also evidence stations in less competitive
   markets were more likely to join, indicating that the rents from the
   creation of BMI were less likely to be competed away in such markets.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect of tied-in sales by an essential goods
   monopolist in a two-sided market. In a two-sided market, the essential
   goods monopolist may tie a good essential for users, such as an
   operating system, with a platform, such as a media player, in the user
   side of the market, to extract profits not from the user side, but from
   the developer side of the market. From this simple idea, we build a
   simple two-sided market model and show how the essential goods
   monopolist may tie a platform with the essential goods on the user side
   of the market to foreclose a rival firm from the developer side of the
   market. We also analyze various welfare impacts of tying and discuss the
   antitrust implications.},

Title = {Is border carbon adjustment the right tool for the power sector?},

Abstract = {Carbon leakage occurs in any carbon pricing regime that is not global,
   which means all of them so far. That is inherently unfair to sectors
   that are subject to a carbon price but compete with those that are not.
   The European Green Deal aims to rectify the problem in the EU Emissions
   Trading System (ETS) by moving beyond the current second (or third) best
   option, which allocates emissions quotas for free for industrial
   sectors, and by putting a price on carbon at the EU border for selected
   but not yet named sectors. Our recent model-based analysis compares the
   impact of a future border carbon adjustment (BCA) mechanism for the
   power sector with the option of extending the EU ETS to countries
   exporting power to the EU. We demonstrate how differences in the two
   policy tools translate into markedly different impacts. We conclude that
   expanding the geographical scope of the EU ETS is a more effective
   climate policy tool than a BCA. First, it would reduce emissions, while
   a BCA would not. Second, emission trading brings real competition:
   Regions neighbouring the EU will be better integrated into the EU single
   market with a level playing field and lower greenhouse gas emissions. On
   the other hand, the BCA would fence off the EU power sector and increase
   greenhouse gas emissions. Third, compared to a border carbon tax,
   expanding the ETS also yields more revenue to exporting neighbouring
   countries facing higher-than-average challenges to change their
   fossil-heavy power systems. Key policy insights The introduction of a
   new policy tool, the border carbon adjustment mechanism, which aims to
   create fair competition and trigger more ambitious climate policy action
   in trading partners, is a legitimate action of the European Union.
   However, the extension of EU ETS is a more effective climate policy tool
   than a border carbon adjustment mechanism as the latter increases
   overall emissions. The border carbon adjustment mechanism is rather a
   competition policy tool that provides a level playing field for
   electricity producers inside and outside the EU. The price impact of the
   policy tool choice merits attention: the extension of the EU ETS drives
   up prices in neighbouring countries (except the West Balkan region), but
   the additional quota revenues can be used to alleviate the burden on
   vulnerable social groups.},

Title = {Learning from difference: The new architecture of experimentalist

Journal = {EUROPEAN LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {271-327},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article argues that current widespread characterisations of EU
   governance as multi-level and networked overlook the emergent
   architecture of the EU's public rule making. In this architecture,
   framework goals (such as full employment, social inclusion, `good water
   status', a unified energy grid) and measures for gauging their
   achievement are established by joint action of the Member States and EU
   institutions. Lower-level units (such as national ministries or
   regulatory authorities and the actors with whom they collaborate) are
   given the freedom to advance these ends as they see fit. But in return
   for this autonomy, they must report regularly on their performance and
   participate in a peer review in which their results are compared with
   those pursuing other means to the same general ends. Finally, the
   framework goals, performance measures, and decision-making procedures
   themselves are periodically revised by the actors, including new
   participants whose views come to be seen as indispensable to full and
   fair deliberation. Although this architecture cannot be read off from
   either Treaty provisions or textbook accounts of the formal competences
   of EU institutions, the article traces its emergence and diffusion
   across a wide range of policy domains, including telecommunications,
   energy, drug authorisation, occupational health and safety, employment
   promotion, social inclusion, pensions, health care, environmental
   protection, food safety, maritime safety, financial services,
   competition policy, state aid, anti-discrimination policy and
   fundamental rights.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is the assessment of the competitive
   environment in the Russian oil market. The subject-matter of the study
   is the Russian oil and gas companies as a basis of the Energy market. We
   check the hypothesis about the development of the mechanism of
   corrective condition in the sphere of preliminary control of market
   concentrations in the fuel and energy complex (FEC). The basis of this
   research is the modern theory of industry markets studying various
   structures of the markets, the behavior of their participants, probable
   consequences of their functioning and interaction, as well as the impact
   of the state on the functioning of markets, its participants, and the
   results of their activities. We calculated and analyzed the key
   indicators characterizing the processes of market concentration in the
   oil industry. We also considered the competition policy of the Russian
   Federation in mergers and acquisitions deals (M\&A deals) concerning oil
   and gas assets. The authors estimated over 460 decisions made by the
   Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation for the period
   from 2011 to 2015 in the control on economic concentration in
   fuel-and-energy industry. Based on the data characterizing the
   development of competitive environment, we have proved that the
   considered goods market belongs to markets with insufficiently developed
   competition. The results of the research will make a certain
   contribution to studying the efficiency of M\&A transactions in the oil
   and gas industry, and also can be applied for the implementation of
   anti-monopoly actions by the Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian
   Federation.},

Abstract = {Electricity mergers pose distinct challenges for competition policy.
   Electricity demand is highly inelastic in the short run, storage is
   limited, and transmission constraints limit the ability to substitute
   generation at other locations. As a result, a merger can affect prices
   in many different markets and even generators with small market shares
   may be able to exercise market power. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory
   Commission's approach for screening horizontal mergers, based on the
   concentration thresholds in the Department of Justice/Federal Trade
   Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines, can fail to identify mergers
   that lessen competition, and mergers that fail the FERC screen may have
   no significant anticompetitive effect. We propose competitive residual
   demand (CRD) analysis, which examines the supply curves of the markets
   affected by a merger and considers the ability and incentive of firms to
   raise prices before and after a proposed merger. CRD analysis is a
   relatively easy way to address the incentives for generators to exercise
   market power and relies on data that are often available. Vertical
   (convergent) mergers between electricity and gas raise additional
   concerns, and we propose a methodology to screen vertical mergers.},

Title = {Won't Get Fooled Again: A supervised machine learning approach for
   screening gasoline cartels},
Journal = {ENERGY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We combine supervised machine learning techniques with statistical
   moments of the gasoline price distribution to detect cartels in the
   Brazilian retail market. Standard deviation, coefficient of variation,
   spread, skewness, and kurtosis are predictors that can help identify and
   predict anti-competitive market behavior. We evaluate each classifier
   and discuss the trade-offs related to false-positive (detect cartel when
   it does not exist) and false-negative (do not detect cartel when it does
   exist) predictions. The competition authority needs effective monitoring
   and often anticipating cartel movements. With this in mind, we test the
   algorithms' performance in new datasets (ex-ante screening). Our results
   show that false-negative outcomes can critically increase when the main
   objective is to minimize false-positive predictions. The models' overall
   average scoring rate for testing and predicting cartels in the same city
   is 96.22\%. When we train the algorithms in one city and predict the
   cartel outcomes in other cities, on average, the overall scoring rate is
   equal to 73.75\%. Our work suggests that machine learning classifiers
   have positive attributes and can provide valuable contributions to
   cartels' deterrence. In addition, we offer a policy prescription
   discussion for antitrust authorities regarding the pros and cons of
   proactive tools for inhibiting collusive agreements in retail gasoline
   markets.},

Title = {ADVOCACY OF COMPETITION IN THE WORLD AND UKRAINE: COMPARATIVE
   CHARACTERISTICS},
Journal = {ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN EASTERN EUROPE},
Abstract = {Background: The advocacy of competition is a modern civilisational
   mechanism of cooperation, which balances private and public interests in
   economic activity and realises the functions of state management and
   control of economic activity, ensuring reasonable distribution of public
   goods. Competition is a fundamental driving force that determines the
   course of economic processes and contributes to the growth of economic
   prosperity and innovation in society. Its provision, protection, and
   development are among the main priorities of state economic policy in
   general and competition policy in particular. The purpose of this
   article is a comparative legal analysis of the advocacy of competition
   in different countries. This study will also identify the peculiarities
   of the use of advocacy tools in these places. Methods: In studying the
   proposed problem, the following methods were used: general philosophical
   and general scientific (dialectical, systemic, formal-logical, etc.);
   universal (induction, deduction); special-scientific (formal-legal,
   comparative law); interpretation of the rules, etc. One of the main
   methods used is the comparative method for researching the common and
   distinctive features of the advocacy of competition in the EU, USA,
   Mexico, the Republic of South Africa, and Ukraine. Results and
   Conclusions: The results show that countries with advanced economies
   have approached advocacy of competition gradually after more than a
   century of anti-monopoly competition legislation. In
   post-transformational economies, we see the formation of competitive
   policy principles activated after independence and the transition to
   market-based business practices. The globalisation of international
   trade relations leads to the need to implement complex competition
   advocacy programs and unify norms at the level of individual states and
   unions. Advocacy of competition remains important as a tool of
   self-regulation of economic activity. The European vector of Ukraines'
   development caused the emergence of new mechanisms of interaction
   between the state, the individual, and society. Having chosen to strive
   for European integration, Ukraine began to build a new model of
   cooperation between all market participants, the introduction of which
   was based on the provisions of the Association Agreement between
   Ukraine, on the one hand, and the EU, the European Atomic Energy
   Community and their member states, on the other hand, using
   implementation mechanisms of both individual norms and entire
   institutions of public-private partnership. The implementation of
   competition advocacy mechanisms in Ukraine is applied using the
   mechanisms of the analogy of individual norms and tools of competition
   policy. The formation of new good competitive practices is connected
   with russias' war.},

Abstract = {Deregulation of Japanese electric power industry began in 1995. After
   the amendment of Electricity Utility Industry Law in 1995, competition
   was partially introduced in a generation sector and retail competition
   started from 2000. Eligibility to choose suppliers was gradually
   extended from larger to smaller customers. As of 2008, almost all
   customers except households can choose their electricity suppliers.
   Based upon both previous implementation result of competition policy and
   review on their achievement, Japanese government will begin new policy
   debate in 2013 to assess further retail competition which includes
   household customers. To prepare for policy suggestion on the future
   electric power industry, this study examines the cost structure of
   Japanese electricity distribution. For the purpose, we estimate a
   multi-product translog cost function of Japanese electricity
   distribution from 1983 to 2003. Using the estimated cost function, we
   calculate several economic measures such as productivity growth,
   technical change and economies of scale and scope. The empirical results
   of this study indicate the improvement in productivity growth after
   deregulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The market and consumer welfare effects of mid-level ethanol blends in
   the US fuel market},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {149-159},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study examines the prospect that a consumer-driven market could
   eventually replace the myriad regulations and demand quotas in the US
   ethanol and gasoline fuel market. Given efficient households that
   minimize the cost of operating automobiles, recent vehicle technology
   that improves blended fuel substitution, and typical market conditions
   of the last five years, blended fuels with 20\% ethanol concentration
   could occupy a volume of 82.2 billion gallons in a 138.3 billion gallon
   gasoline market. The consumer welfare gain associated with blended fuel
   is \$15.9 billion annually for US consumers, or about \$1000 over the
   life of a vehicle.
   The ethanol demand associated with a voluntary blended fuel market is
   16.4 BGY, slightly more than the conventional component of the Renewable
   Fuels Standard. It is time to replace the corn RFS with a free market.
   But an active competition policy in the fuel marketing system may also
   be required. Intervention for the impending Biomass Ethanol Industry,
   such as a subsidy or an exemption a carbon tax, may also be in order.

Abstract = {This article discusses joint and conflicting interests between Norway
   and the EU concerning the huge Norwegian exports of natural gas. In
   particular. the article focuses on the introduction of the so-called Gas
   Directive. and the EU's objections to the organisation of the Norwegian
   gas sales through the Gas Negotiation Committee (GFU). It concludes that
   Norway shares many interests with the purchasing countries as well as
   with other exporters, However, no other country shares Norway's total
   interests in a strong market position, high and stable prices and the
   development of an independent gas policy The article argues that Norway
   has a need to develop an independent gas strategy and foreign policy
   that explicitly take care of its special economic and political
   interests as a large gas exporter to the European market. There is a
   need for a more open debate to develop such instruments in a robust
   manner. The article also argues that the EU should develop a
   comprehensive energy policy itself before a competition policy is
   exercised in such a particular field as the markets for non-renewable
   natural gas. Non ay should play a more active role to influence the
   formulation of EU policy in this area.},

Title = {European Commission merger control: Combining competition and the

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {443-464},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The article examines the European Commission's use of its legal powers
   over mergers. It discusses and tests two views. One is that the
   `neoliberal' Commission has ended previous industrial policies of aiding
   `national champion' firms to grow through mergers and instead pursues a
   `merger-constraining' policy of vigorously using its legal powers to
   block mergers. The other is that the Commission follows an
   `integrationist policy' of seeking the development of larger European
   firms to deepen economic integration. It examines Commission decisions
   under the 1989 EC Merger Regulation between 1990 and 2009. It selects
   three major sectors that are `likely' for the `merger-constraining' view
   - banking, energy and telecommunications - and analyses a dataset of
   almost 600 Commission decisions and then individual merger cases. It
   finds that the Commission has approved almost all mergers, including by
   former `national champion' firms. There have been only two prohibitions
   over 20 years in the three sectors and the outcome has been the creation
   of larger European firms through mergers. It explains how the Commission
   can pursue an integrationist policy through the application of
   competition processes and criteria. The wider implication is that the
   Commission can combine competition policy with achieving the `industrial
   policy' aim of aiding the development of larger European firms.},

Abstract = {Extreme value theory can analyze the extreme changes of financial market
   returns, and it is an effective financial risk management model. The
   distribution characteristics of financial assets' returns are the core
   content of all financial models. The assumptions about the fluctuation
   behavior of returns and its distribution characteristics are of great
   theoretical and practical significance for the measurement and
   management of financial risks. We compare the estimates of value at risk
   by the peak over threshold model with that by the traditional
   variance-covariance method. During downturns, the peak over threshold
   model based value at risk estimates is higher relative to that by the
   traditional variance-covariance approach. At the same time, this paper
   conducts statistical analysis of basic data through data collection and
   combines the establishment of statistical methods to study the practical
   effects of various factors on carbon productivity in China. In addition,
   this paper constructs a low-carbon economic neural network model based
   on particle swarm optimization to study carbon emissions. Finally, on
   the basis of analysis and research, this paper puts forward policy
   recommendations for China's future low-carbon development model, and
   then provides reference for guiding the development of China's future
   low-carbon model and provides theoretical basis for subsequent related
   research.},

Abstract = {This article aims to investigate the integrity-related risks for
   companies engaging with third parties in the construction and civil
   engineering industry. The business partner compliance process of a
   multinational construction engineering company is assessed through
   internal interviews with integrity officers per business sector and per
   region in a static and dynamic strategy framework. The actual process is
   the internal evaluation of a ready-made tool bought from a service
   supplier that assesses how the risks related to corruption are covered
   in order to determine the level of due diligence necessary when engaging
   with a specific third party. This study finds that companies must
   involve their own experts to improve integrity tools. Collecting expert
   opinions on risk is necessary to allow an improved understanding of the
   scope of the tool. This study reflects on new ways for improving the
   integrity tool and demonstrates the necessity to cover risks not solely
   associated with corruption and bribery, but also with human rights,
   conflict of interest, antitrust and competition, as well as compliance
   with regulations to fully protect a company's integrity. (C) 2020

Title = {A Comprehensive Study of Air Transport Liberalization Through the Lens
   of Strategic Airline Alliances},
Journal = {AIR \& SPACE LAW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4-5},
Pages = {347-391},
Abstract = {The present study examines the issue of the liberalization of air
   transport through the lens of strategic airline alliances. Alliances are
   seen as a corollary to the suboptimal regulatory framework governing
   international civil aviation, stemming from `the nationality rule'. The
   `nationality rule' provides that majority ownership and effective
   control of an airline must be vested in the country that designates it.
   This requirement has nurtured the establishment of national airlines and
   has prevented the industry from consolidating out of fear that traffic
   rights, negotiated bilaterally between States, will be lost. What is
   more, it has locked States into a `prisoner's dilemma', stalling
   liberalization. Airlines have reacted by forging alliances to emulate
   mergers and reap merger-like efficiencies. The present study examines
   the way that the airline industry has positioned itself strategically
   within the suboptimal regulatory framework in order to unleash the
   benefits of liberalization. It finds that the model of open skies, metal
   neutrality and antitrust immunity, pioneered by KLM and Northwest in
   1992, has embedded a degree of de facto liberalization. Twenty-five
   years after its introduction, this model seems to have exhausted its
   liberalizing potential, threatening to lock States into yet another
   prisoner's dilemma. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
   is presently preparing a broad programme to deal with a wide variety of
   aspects of air transport liberalization, including airline alliances.
   The present study aims to contribute to the ICAO's research effort and,
   more broadly, to the long list of works on air transport liberalization.},

Abstract = {Larger firms are often found to be more likely to participate in
   voluntary environmental programs, but few studies have investigated the
   mechanism through which firm size matters. This paper studies oil and
   gas firms' likelihood of voluntarily disclosing information on hydraulic
   fracturing, an industrial process that involves the use of toxic
   chemicals. I find evidence that firm visibility is an important
   mechanism through which firm size affects the voluntary disclosure rate.
   My findings suggest that voluntary approaches to environmental
   protection are unlikely to be effective if many targeted firms are small
   and not visible to the public.},

   regulate shared ownership also affect efforts provided by the parties at
   the invention stage and hence impact the quality of the patented
   technology. We rely on exogenous legal differences between the United
   States and Europe concerning the ability of co-owners of patents to
   license the patented technology to third parties to show that the data
   are consistent with our theoretical predictions.},

Abstract = {In 1994/95, the Australian rail freight task was approximately 100
   billion tonne kilometres (btkm). This freight task included some 37 btkm
   for the haulage of iron ore in Western Australia, 28 btkm for coal
   haulage in Queensland and New South Wales and about 16 btkm for
   interstate rail freight. This paper mainly concerns how improvements can
   be made to the efficiency and competitiveness of interstate rail freight
   services through the upgrading of sections of mainline track that
   currently have severe speed - weight restrictions. Recent improvements
   in rail freight efficiency are discussed, with emphasis on two
   indicators: average unit revenues (cents per net tonne km), and average
   energy efficiency (net tonne km per MJ). Rail freight efficiency is high
   for the Western Australia iron-ore operations, Queensland coal
   operations and Adelaide-Perth general freight operations. However,
   between Australia's three largest cities of Melbourne, Sydney and
   Brisbane, some 36\% of the mainline track fails to meet basic fast
   freight train standards with a ruling grade of 1 in 66 and no curve
   radius less than 800 m. The contraints on efficient rail freight
   operations imposed by severe terrain, and how the effects of terrain may
   be reduced by improved track alignment, are discussed. Some economically
   warranted rail track investment measures are outlined, including those
   identified for a National Transport Planning Taskforce. These measures
   have the potential to reduce liquid fuel use by over 250 million litres
   a year. Factors affecting competitive neutrality between road and rail
   freight that are outside of the present scope of Australia's National
   Competition Policy are broadly considered. These factors include the
   extensive upgrading of the National Highway System with full Federal
   funding, and low levels of road cost recovery from heavy trucks
   operating over long distances.},

Abstract = {The regulatory reforms in the energy sector require a dual-track
   approach: On the one hand, the markets for electricity and gas should be
   deregulated speedily; on the other hand, incentives are needed for
   environmentally sound supply structures without a new tide of
   regulations being created. As yet, no hard and fast solution is to be
   seen, but it is possible to outline the basic data for compromises which
   at least would be an improvement over the status quo and would open up
   opportunities for a sustainable optimization along the lines of a market
   economy.
   The plans of the German federal government to give up all monopolist
   exceptions in the power industry using line transmission, such as the
   abolition of demarcation agreements which, at present, are still
   permitted in competition policy, and of the exclusivity clause in
   license agreements, may be able to create sufficient space for intense
   competition to develop. However no segregation in transmission lines
   should have an impact on developments. This means that regulations
   intensifying competition should be sought both for the construction of
   new grid systems and for requests by third parties to run their products
   through transmission systems they do not own. The criteria applied to
   licensing new lines should be worded in such a way that local opposition
   will be unable to cause excessive delays which would be intolerable to
   the national economy.
   However, deregulation is but one side of the coin. It is a way to tap
   successfully, and for the long term, the potential for cost and price
   reductions for electricity and gas. On the other hand however also the
   ecological risks of energy supply must be limited further Broad-based
   incentives must be offered to energy supplies whose generation gives
   rise to less CO2, in order not to lose sight of the need to protect the
   climate.
   There should be no debate about the preservation of CO2-free nuclear
   power as an option in Germany. Moreover, the efficiency of energy
   conversion and energy use must be increased and, at the same time, the
   use of renewable energy sources must be stepped up in the long nln. The
   introduction of power transmission regulations by the government giving
   priority to `'eco-electricity'' would entail considerable need for more
   regulation. In that case, the desired invigoration of the competitive
   forces of the market would threaten to end in a spiral of
   interventionist measures. Likewise, the government regulations about
   electricity pur chases and prices under the Electricity Supply Act are
   far from being a perfect solution. Obviously, the government needs money
   for all these measures. A value added tax differentiated on ecological
   grounds would be a rather general tool leaving a high degree of freedom
   to addresses without containing any terms controlling their behavior.
   Bonn needs approval from Brussels for such steps. The German federal
   government should make it clear to the European Union that deregulation
   requires ecological support in conformity with the market. In addition
   to energy taxation coordinated EU-wide, this could include a value added
   tax differentiated ecologically. Even though no workable solution has as
   yet been found for the introduction of eco-taxes, this topic should not
   be lost in the tax reform in Germany.},

Title = {A Multi-Stochastic SMR Siting Model Applied to the Province of
   Saskatchewan, Canada: Emphasis on Technological Competition and Policy
   Impacts},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {178},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Existing electric power systems have been being faced with great
   concerns on climate change mitigation through the reduction of
   greenhouse gas emissions in recent decades. Small modular reactors
   (SMRs) are considered the next generation of power technologies,
   offering stable, safe, and environmental-friendly power. This research
   initially establishes a multi-stochastic SMR siting model (SSMRS) based
   on a dynamic mixed-integer left-handside chance-constrained multistage
   programming (DMLCM) method, aiming to provide solid bases for electric
   power system management to promote GHG mitigation under uncertainties
   and advance the practical application of SMRs in a regional electric
   power system. The model is applied to emission-intensive Saskatchewan
   power systems, which have a high reliance on fossil fuels. The
   commissioned coal-fired and gas-fired power plants in Saskatchewan are
   identified as potential sites for employing SMRs. A series of scenarios
   regarding technical development and carbon policies are analyzed to
   study the interrelationships among technological competition, policy
   efficiency, and system-failure risk. This is the first attempt to apply
   an optimization-based modeling approach for siting SMRs in Saskatchewan
   with detailed consideration of other new-emerging emission reduction
   technologies. We found that a carbon tax ranging from 30 to 40\$/tonne
   might be reasonable in Saskatchewan after 2030 while the SMR would be
   partly commercially viable, occupying similar to >15\% of total
   installed capacity. The solution obtained could provide scientific bases
   for decision-makers to determine optimal schemes for power supply,
   capacity expansions, and system costs under environmental targets, and
   particularly identify construction schemes for SMRs at specific sites in
   different periods under various risk levels.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the article is to characterize the development and
   specific features of inflation in Russia on the basis of its theoretical
   justification and practical analysis. The article discusses the
   monetarist and Keynesian approaches to the characterization of
   inflation. The paper shows that the equation of exchange from the
   quantity theory of money, which is the basis of the monetarist theory of
   inflation, does not allow to make an unambiguous conclusion about the
   direct relationship between money supply and price level in the economy.
   The authors give the theoretical substantiation of cost-push inflation
   from the position of microeconomic theory, which is denied by the
   representatives of the monetarist school. We characterize the specific
   features of inflation in the period of market transformations in Russia.
   The article shows the considerable role of the cost factors of cost-push
   inflation: the monopolization of the economy, rise in the prices of
   energy and raw materials. There is an absence of the direct relationship
   between inflation and money supply growth in large part of the period of
   the 2000. The authors determine the dependence between the exchange rate
   and inflation in the Russian economy, which is most evident during
   periods of significant devaluation of the national currency, as a rule,
   associated with a significant increase in world oil prices. The paper
   notes that the significant decline in aggregate demand that occurred in
   Russia in recent years have reduced the level of inflation in 2016.
   Despite this, the reduction of inflation and its transformation to slow
   cost-push inflation was combined with negative consequences for the
   economy: the decrease of investments and production development,
   reduction of the living standards of the population. The authors
   conducted the analysis of inflation on the level of the subjects of the
   Russian Federation, which has confirmed the significant role of causes
   of cost-push inflation in the economy. The research has led to the
   conclusion about the appropriateness of measures on the stimulation of
   aggregate demand and the development of the national economy by reducing
   interest rates, increasing investment activity, developing competition
   and efficiency of antitrust regulation.},

Abstract = {Protectionist tendencies of EU Member States have always been evident in
   sectors of industry that previously were dominated largely by
   state-owned companies, namely, the banking, defense, energy, postal,
   telecommunications, transport, and water sectors where, following
   privatization, Member States have sought to preserve or create so-called
   ``national champions.{''} However, a new wave of protectionism or
   economic patriotism by Member States has broken out recently, as
   exemplified by the long-running saga of the takeover of Endesa, the
   Spanish electricity group. This article examines the compatibility of
   special rights and other state measures with the EC's single market
   objectives within the framework of the EC Treaty and their impact on
   foreign takeovers and investments. It also examines the initiatives
   taken by the Commission in order to eliminate such measures and analyzes
   the potential remedies available to foreign investors when confronted
   with such measures. Such remedies include the application of the
   Commission's powers under Article 21 of the EC Merger Regulation that
   arguably could be used to even greater effect with the abolition or
   curtailment of the two-thirds rule.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW \& ECONOMICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {113-149},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority has opened two major
   investigations into the retail energy and banking sectors, and
   identifies weak consumer response as a potential theory of harm in both
   sectors. Consumers of many regulated services, including energy and
   banking, need to make active moves to switch suppliers, with profound
   consequences for how well the market functions. We identify differences
   in expected gains across demographic groups, particularly with respect
   to age and income, the associated changes in activity and implications
   for policy. We find that potential gains and anticipated switching time
   are associated with changes in consumer activity, but with differences
   between markets, demographic groups and individuals. Rather than
   concentrate on the average consumer response, we find variations across
   demographic groups, and that well informed vulnerable consumers are not
   necessarily less responsive than others, once we control for their
   expectations. We conclude that sector regulators and agencies who wish
   to encourage consumer action need to differentiate their policies:
   strategies to emphasize potential gains and reduce anticipated switching
   time are the most likely to increase consumer activity, but programs
   need to be tailored to particular markets and target groups if they are
   to be effective in stimulating consumer activity.},

Abstract = {The Russian Federation has begun restructuring its electricity sector,
   following the standard restructuring model of complete vertical
   separation of generation from transmission, with the aim of creating
   competition in regional generation markets. This paper examines the
   structure of the six principal regional generation markets that are in
   their early stages of development and argues that they are likely to be
   characterized by high levels of market power on the part of individual
   privatized generation companies, especially during the peak winter
   demand season. These levels-considerably higher than those that caused
   competitive problems in California-seem to create a serious risk of
   price spikes in deregulated wholesale electricity markets, and thus of
   significant price increases to consumers of electricity. Published by

Title = {Are economists Kings? Economic evidence and discretionary assessments at
   the UK utility regulatory agencies},

Abstract = {UK sectoral regulatory authorities are hybrid communities of, among
   others, lawyers and economists. Since the liberalization of essential
   services, expert economists enjoy broad discretionary powers in
   advancing the agencies' broad statutory objectives. Yet, despite the
   significant societal impact of economic regulation, existing scholarship
   in the fields of competition law and regulation and public law has, with
   very few exceptions, disregarded these actors and the very essence of
   their work. This article aims to address this gap in the literature by
   blending theoretical with empirical insights deriving from 14
   semi-structured elite interviews with regulatory economists in the
   regulatory agencies for energy (Office for Gas and Electricity Markets),
   telecoms (Office for Communications), and water (Office of Water
   Services). It explores the increased reliance on economics in the
   regulatory decision-making process and the impact this has had on the
   authorities' decision-making and discretion, when making complex
   trade-offs between the various goals of the regulatory enterprise. In
   doing so, it puts forward a theoretical framework inspired by Craig
   Parsons' typology of political action so as to identify and examine the
   nature and scope of the constraints that inform and shape the influence
   of economics in the exercise of regulatory discretion. This endeavour is
   significant in the sense that it is the first of its kind and, in that
   it provides a normative framework of analysis that can be applied in
   other areas of regulation heavily infused with and influenced by
   economic evidence and analysis, such as `pure' competition law
   enforcement by both sectoral and competition authorities.},

Abstract = {Residential consumers remain reluctant to choose new electricity
   suppliers. Even the most successful jurisdictions, four US states and
   other countries, have had to adopt extensive consumer education
   procedures that serve largely to confirm that choosing electricity
   suppliers is daunting. Electricity is not unique in this respect;
   numerous studies find that consumers are generally reluctant to switch
   brands, even when they are well-informed about product characteristics.
   If consumers prefer not to choose, opening regulated markets can reduce
   welfare, even for some consumers who do switch, as the incumbent can
   exploit this preference by raising price above the formerly regulated
   level. Policies to open markets might be successful even if limited to
   industrial and commercial customers, with residential prices based on
   those in nominally competitive wholesale markets. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {By the mid 1950s, there was a need for infrared-transmitting materials
   with improved optical and mechanical characteristics for military and
   commercial instruments. The newly invented ``heat-seeking{''} missile
   also required a more durable infrared-transmitting dome. Some properties
   of ZnS were known from studies of natural minerals. More properties of
   pure ZnS and ZnSe were measured with single crystals gown in Air Force
   and industrial laboratories in the 1950s. In 1956, a team led by William
   Parsons at the Eastman Kodak Hawk-Eye Works in Rochester, New York began
   to apply the technique of hot pressing to make infrared-transmitting
   ceramics from powders. This work led to commercial production of six
   materials, including ZnS (IRTRAN((R)) 2) and ZnSe (IRTRAN((R)) 4) in the
   1960s. Because the hot pressed materials could not be made in very large
   sizes and suffered from undesirable optical losses, the Air Force began
   to look for alternative manufacturing methods around 1970. Almost
   immediately, highly successful materials were produced by chemical vapor
   deposition under Air Force sponsorship by a team led by James Pappis at
   the Raytheon Research Division in Waltham, Massachusetts.
   Chemical-vapor-deposited materials replaced hot pressed materials in
   most applications within a few years. From a stream of Air Force
   contracts in the 1970s and early 1980s, Raytheon produced two different
   grades of ZnS for windows and domes, one grade of ZnSe for high-energy
   CO2 laser windows, and a composite ZnS/ZnSe window for aircraft sensor
   pods. In 1980, a competitor called CVD, Inc., was formed by Robert
   Donadio, who came from the Raytheon Research Division. CVD began with a
   license from Raytheon, but soon sued Raytheon, arguing that the license
   violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. Raytheon countersued for breach of
   employment contracts and misappropriation of trade secrets. In 1984, a
   jury ruled in favor of CVD, which went on to build a lucrative business
   in ZnSe and ZnS. CVD was eventually purchased, first by Morton, and
   later by Robin \& Haas. II-VI, Inc. was formed in 1971 by Carl J.
   Johnson and James E. Hawkey to produce CdTe optics for industrial CO2
   lasers. When Raytheon introduced ZnSe into the market in 1974, it was
   obvious that ZnSe was superior to CdTe, so H-VI purchased ZnSe from
   Raytheon to produce optical components. The supply of ZnSe was never
   stable enough for II-VI, which therefore began its own effort to deposit
   ZnSe in 1975. In 1980, II-VI became an investor in and customer of CVD,
   Inc., buying a substantial portion of the ZnSe that could be supplied by
   both Raytheon and CVD. Still pressed to meet customer demand, II-VI
   built its first ZnSe production furnace in the period 1983-1986. A
   second furnace came on line in 1988 and two more were operational by
   1990. Finally attaining excess capacity, H-VI became a supplier of ZnS
   as well as ZnSe. In 1990, Raytheon exited the ZnS and ZnSe business,
   leaving it mainly to CVD and II-VI.},

Title = {Should Health Care Systems Become Insurers?},
Journal = {OBSTETRICAL \& GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {69-70},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Incentives under the Affordable Care Act are making more health care
   systems assume the risk of paying for patient care, making boundaries
   between care delivery organizations and insurers less clear-cut. Bundled
   payments, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations
   transfer financial risk from payers to health care systems. The goal of
   health care systems that adopt risk contracts is to contain costs due to
   the increase in financial pressures as Medicaid expands and
   reimbursements for Medicare and fee-for-service care shrink. Accountable
   care organization contracts have shown promise in slowing the increase
   in medical expenditures for public and private payers. Some health care
   systems hold ownership in an associated health plan, with increasing
   numbers of systems developing new ways of engaging with health plans.
   Physicians and hospitals must distinguish between different types of
   arrangements. A full ownership partnership encompasses joint governance
   between the insurance plan and health care system; all participants in
   the plan receive care from the associated health system. In partial
   ownership, the health care system owns a stake in the insurer, but
   governance and care relationships are not totally overlapping. In a
   partnership, the formal relationship with the insurance plan
   preferentially refers patients to the health care system, and the system
   enters into risk contracts for the patients. Finally, in contractual
   arrangements, health systems enter into risk-bearing contracts with
   insurance plans for specific patient populations. For health systems
   that assume risk, the arrangement drives integration, such that most of
   a patient's health care needs and associated payments are addressed by a
   single network, allowing care to be better coordinated. Care provided
   outside the network is paid for by the insurer. Cost savings are
   generated by decreasing volume-based incentives in fee-for-service
   payment systems that can create overuse. Linking health care systems and
   payers can also overcome a lack of price transparency. One challenge is
   whether health care system-insurer partnerships will conflict with
   existing state and federal regulations designed to maintain a
   competitive marketplace. These include antitrust regulations, bans on
   the corporate practice of medicine, and prohibitions on fee-splitting.
   Another concern is that the health care system and insurers do not
   necessarily have the same goals and human resources. Merging these
   models will require significant investments of energy and capital that
   may distract from core activities. In addition, most health systems are
   ill-equipped to handle the complex operations of the insurance business.
   Systems must maintain adequate capital reserves to be a financially
   viable health plan. Therefore, health systems must be more judicious
   about assuming risk and managing population health and costs. Successful
   partnerships between health care systems and insurers will require
   certain components. (1) The integrated arrangement must rest on a
   foundation of high-functioning primary health care. (2) It must
   incorporate system-wide processes for quality improvement. (3) It must
   engage patients with outreach initiatives for disease self-management
   and preventive care. (4) Systems must be able to manage costs of care.
   With care delivery transformation as the ultimate goal, the leaders of
   health systems must nurture and build on momentum in a sustainable way.},

Abstract = {Even the briefest and most superficial perusal of leading mainstream
   economics journals will attest to the degree that mathematical formalism
   has captured the economics profession. Whereas up to the early 20th
   century virtually all of the output of the dismal scientists was in the
   literary format, by the early 21st century this is not at all any longer
   the case. Mathematical formalism is supposed to serve economics, and yet
   now true economic insight has been crowded out by the math. If
   mainstream neoclassical economics is to come back to its proper path, a
   far less central role for mathematical economics, statistics and
   econometrics will have to be fashioned.},

Abstract = {Governmental and particularly private funding has recently and
   dramatically expanded for both BECCS and DAC technologies. This funding
   and the associated research, development, and deployment efforts will
   generate intellectual property rights, particularly patent rights in
   NETS. As with access to medicines, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted
   concerns that patent rights may incentivize RD\&D at the cost of
   affordable access to the relevant technologies. Further, access may be
   restricted to particular countries based on sovereignty concerns to seek
   preferential supply agreements through up-front funding. As a result,
   nations will likely turn to controversial ex-post measures, such as
   compulsory licensing, to assure access and to control prices of the
   needed technologies. The same concerns with patent rights likely will
   affect RD\&D of NETS. Although international ex-ante measures exist
   (such as patent pools) which would help to minimize these concerns, such
   measures may not induce the requisite voluntary contributions, or may
   fail to materialize due to political disagreements. Focusing on both US
   law and international developments, this article proposes various
   ex-ante measures that can be adopted by national governments and private
   funders to minimize the likely forthcoming worldwide conflicts that will
   arise over balancing innovation incentives for, and affordable access
   to, patented NETS.},

Abstract = {A basic tenet of microeconomics is that for a competitive industry in
   equilibrium the market price of a product will be equal to its marginal
   cost. This paper develops a model framework and a corresponding
   empirical inference procedure for estimating long-run marginal cost in
   industries where production costs decline over time. In the context of
   the solar photovoltaic (PV) module industry, we rely primarily on
   firm-level financial accounting data to estimate the long-run marginal
   cost of PV modules for the years 2008-2013. During those years, the
   industry experienced both unprecedented price declines and significant
   expansions of manufacturing capacity. We compare the trajectory of
   average sales prices with the estimated long-run marginal costs in order
   to quantify the extent to which actual price declines were attributable
   to reductions in production costs. The trajectory of estimated product
   costs is then extrapolated to forecast an equilibrium trend line for
   future PV module prices.},

Title = {Asymmetric responses in the timing, and magnitude, of changes in
   Australian monthly petrol prices to daily oil price changes},
Journal = {ENERGY ECONOMICS},

Abstract = {This article investigates whether uncompetitive pricing tactics are
   being employed in the retail petrol market in Australia through
   examining the effect of a change in daily oil prices on monthly petrol
   prices. To do so, we incorporate asymmetry into the coefficients of a
   normalised beta weighting function within an Asymmetric Mixed Data
   Sampling (AMIDAS) framework. This enables us to examine both the timing,
   and the lagged marginal effects, of a change in retail petrol prices in
   response to a change in the oil price. We find evidence of asymmetries
   in both the timing, and magnitude, of retail petrol prices to a change
   in the oil price. Specifically, we find that while price falls are
   slowly and symmetrically passed onto consumers, price increases are more
   delayed, but higher in intensity over time. Depending on the capital
   city, when retailers eventually do increase petrol prices, in response
   to an oil price rise with delay, the price rise is between 2.1 and 3.4
   times more than when retailers reduce petrol prices in response to a
   fall in the price of oil. This finding is consistent with retailers
   delaying substantial petrol price rises in order to mask the existence
   of uncompetitive practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Nonlinear Pricing and Tariff Differentiation: Evidence from the British
   Electricity Market},
Journal = {ENERGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {57-77},
Abstract = {Liberalisation of the British household electricity market, in which
   previously monopolised regional markets were exposed to large-scale
   entry, is used as a natural experiment on oligopolistic nonlinear
   pricing. Each oligopolist offered a single two-part electricity tariff,
   but inconsistent with current theory, the two-part tariffs were
   heterogeneous in ways that cannot be attributed to explanations such as
   asymmetric costs or variations in brand loyalty. Instead, the evidence
   suggests that firms deliberately differentiated their tariff structures,
   resulting in market segmentation according to consumers' usage.},

Title = {Measuring The Impact Of Air Pollution On Health Care Costs},
Journal = {HEALTH AFFAIRS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2113-2119},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Air pollution contributes to the development of numerous adverse human
   health outcomes. The Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental
   Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program-Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) tool
   is widely used in estimating the health care costs of air pollution and
   in the development of federal and state regulations and policy. Its
   default features consider only the costs of hospital and emergency
   department admissions. A more complete accounting of the chain of costs
   would include ambulatory and other care. In this article we use employer
   health insurance claims data to infer additional costs that accompany
   hospitalizations but are not included in BenMAP-CE. Including additional
   categories increases BenMAP-CE health care cost estimates by
   approximately 40 percent for respiratory and cardiovascular patients.
   That is, for each dollar of health care costs captured by BenMAP-CE, a
   more complete accounting would include an additional 40 cents. These
   results suggest that because such air pollution costs are
   underestimated, the health care benefits associated with reducing air
   pollution may be much larger than previously estimated.},

Abstract = {We propose a semiparametric test for the value of coefficients in models
   with conditional moment restrictions that has correct size regardless of
   identification strength. The test is in essence an Anderson-Rubin (AR)
   test using nonparametrically estimated instruments to which we apply a
   standard error correction. We show that the test is (1) always
   size-correct, (2) consistent when identification is not too weak, and
   (3) asymptotically equivalent to an infeasible AR test when
   identification is sufficiently strong. We moreover prove that under
   homoskedasticity and strong identification our test has a limiting
   noncentral chi-square distribution under a sequence of local
   alternatives, where the noncentrality parameter is given by a quadratic
   form of the inverse of the semiparametric efficiency bound.},

Abstract = {We use a field experiment to study price discrimination in a market with
   price posting and negotiation. Motivated by concerns that low-income
   consumers do poorly in markets with privately negotiated prices, we
   built a call center staffed with actors armed with bargaining scripts to
   reveal negotiated prices and their determinants. Our actors implement
   sequential bargaining games under incomplete information in the field.
   By experimentally manipulating how information is revealed, we generate
   sequences of price offers that allow us to identify price discrimination
   in negotiations based on retailer perceptions of consumers' search and
   switching costs. We also document differences in price distributions
   between entrants and incumbents, reflecting differences in captivity of
   their respective consumer bases. Finally, we show that higher prices
   paid by lower-income subsidy recipients in our market is not due to
   discriminatory targeting; they can be explained by variation in consumer
   willingness and ability to search and bargain.},
