Abstract = {Competition among alternative pharmaceutical products occurs within
   therapeutic areas and is importantly conditioned upon whether it occurs
   among therapeutic substitutes (alternative molecules - differentiated
   products) or within a particular molecule (a brand-name drug and its
   generic substitutes -homogeneous products). Healthcare institutions
   treat substitution among brand-name and generic drugs differently.
   Hence, competition among therapeutic substitutes may be considerably
   different from competition between a brand-name drug and its generics.
   We address these distinct competitive behaviors in the context of an
   active antitrust issue - foreclosure of generic entry. We empirically
   examine the contours of the relevant antitrust markets in two ways. We
   use the hypothetical monopolist test of the DOJ Merger Guidelines, and
   we conduct exemplar empirical analyses for two therapies (alpha blockers
   and antidepressants). We demonstrate that price competition occurs
   primarily at the level of the molecule. Our work provides a general
   framework for analyzing and defining antitrust markets in the
   pharmaceutical industry.},

Abstract = {In the pharmaceuticals sector there is an inherent tension between
   intellectual property rights and antitrust. This article examines this
   tension over the past 10 years since modernization of EU competition
   law. It looks at three types of problems: (i) restrictions on parallel
   imports; (ii) abuse of administrative procedure; and (iii) pay for delay
   cases. This overview shows that the European Commission is now
   especially active in areas (ii) and (iii) and generally relies on a more
   formalistic approach of finding restrictions by object instead of using
   economic arguments to demonstrate restrictions by effect. The by object
   approach is supported by the EU Courts. Also, the molecule (active
   ingredient) is often regarded as the relevant product market,
   facilitating a finding of dominance. Some national competition
   authorities have followed in the footsteps of the Commission but on the
   whole they are less active, for instance on pay for delay. This may be
   because the EU Courts have yet to rule on this type of case. For
   pharmaceutical companies the net result is that they cannot assume their
   intellectual property rights will stand in the way of a finding of
   antitrust infringement and their behaviour will be scrutinised closely.},

Abstract = {Closing the loopholes of downstream application of the Capper-Volstead
   exemption in the food system and pay for delay in pharmaceuticals is an
   important advance in US and EU antitrust norms. First, pay-for-delay
   conduct has been harmful for pharmaceuticals customers. After ten years
   of litigation that divided circuit courts, the Supreme Court decreed
   that payments to generic drug sellers by the patent holders of the brand
   equivalent that are aimed at delaying entry are illegal, but did so
   under a structured rule-of-reason approach. EU competition authorities
   treat such payments as per se civil infractions. Second, until court
   decisions made in 2011-2014, the reach of the Capper-Volstead Act and
   the legality of pay-for-delay conduct in the drug industry were in
   doubt. In 2015, most federal circuits now clearly agree that, at a
   minimum, acreage restrictions by marketing cooperatives are per se
   illegal. Moreover, any manipulation by farmers' cooperatives of upstream
   supply is also likely to be illegal.},

Abstract = {Trinko emphasized the importance of attention to an industry's
   regulatory regime in determining the role of antitrust law and suggested
   a possible ``expansion of the contours{''} of the Sherman Act in certain
   regulatory contexts. This Note explores Trinko's implications for
   antitrust enforcement in the pharmaceutical industry which, though
   heavily regulated, lacks an industry regulator that polices competition.
   It focuses on product hopping, a strategy launched by manufacturers of
   brand name drugs to undermine competition from generic substitutes.
   Parties have challenged product hopping as anticompetitive, and the
   judicial treatment thus far has hinged on the presence of consumer
   coercion. However, such an approach disregards the pharmaceutical
   industry's unique market structure and its regulatory regime. This Note
   inquires into the real anticompetitive harm from product hopping through
   the lens of Trinko. It proposes that courts undertake the antitrust
   analysis with an eye toward the industry's regulatory
   regime-particularly, state drug product selection (DPS) laws-and the
   legislative policy judgment it embodies, in addition to engaging such
   traditional antitrust concerns as promoting innovation and preserving
   free competition. This Note develops a framework that gives
   manufacturers freedom to innovate, responds to the limits of antitrust
   law, and punishes product hoppers that subvert the specific type of
   competition state legislatures sought to establish in fashioning DPS
   laws.},

Abstract = {At present, monopolistic acts are frequent in the active pharmaceutical
   ingredient (API) industry, which exerts a serious impact on the normal
   functioning of the API market and pharmaceutical market. This industry
   is closely bound up with numerous patients and is a major livelihood
   issue. Antitrust enforcement agencies have investigated seven API
   antitrust cases. Based on these seven cases, this article will compare
   the similarities and differences between the National Development and
   Reform Commission and the Administration for Industry \& Commerce (AIC)
   in law enforcement approaches and analyze the advantages and defects of
   antitrust enforcement in the API industry in China.},

Title = {The man who managed your marketing? Estes Kefauver and the drug hearings
   on antitrust and monopoly},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL RESEARCH IN MARKETING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {429-451},
Abstract = {Purpose - The US Senate hearings on pricing in the market for drugs in
   1959, and lasting ten months, was part of a series of wider senatorial
   hearings into a range of American industries including the markets for
   milk, bread, automobiles, and steel, undertaken by the Senate
   Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly, chaired by Senator Estes
   Kefauver of Tennessee between 1957 and 1963. The study examines how a
   body that had the initial investigational remit to examine the subject
   of `administered prices' in the drug industry, became instead largely a
   systematic critique of the marketing activities and techniques practiced
   by pharmaceutical firms of the day.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study draws on the Senate Subcommittee
   hearings for prescription drugs.
   Findings - Three objectionable marketing practices were identified by
   the Antitrust Subcommittee: the use of sales representatives and
   high-pressure sales techniques; industry promotional practices,
   expenditure and deceptiveness; and the role of drug branding to hold
   consumers captive to major brands.
   Research limitations/implications - Rather than being an investigation
   that was perceived by some as out of tune with the major events of the
   day (most notably civil rights), it will be demonstrated that, far from
   being an anachronism, the hearings were an important precursor to the
   consumer rights movement, which peaked in the 1960s and 1970s, and a
   link will be established between antitrust issues and contemporary
   consumer politics.
   Originality/value - The paper demonstrates the historical value of
   studying regulatory body appraisals of marketing practices.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we show that a provision in antitrust law to allow patent
   settlements with a later market entry of generics than the date that is
   expected under patent litigation can increase consumer welfare. We
   introduce a policy parameter for determining the optimal additional
   period for collusion that would incentivize the challenging of weak
   patents and maximize consumer welfare. While in principle, later market
   entry leads to higher profits and lower consumer welfare, this can be
   more than compensated for if more patents are challenged as a result.},

Abstract = {Economics at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) supports both the
   competition and consumer protection missions of the agency. In this
   year's essay we discuss two issues, one from each of the agency's
   missions. First, we focus on intellectual property issues in
   pharmaceuticals. Specifically, we discuss the principal rationale for
   antitrust concerns about certain patent dispute settlements in the
   ethical drug industry. Then, we discuss consumer economics, our recent
   behavioral economics conference, and how behavioral economics influences
   our thinking about consumer policy.},

Abstract = {The paper reviews recent developments in the enforcement of competition
   rules in EU pharmaceutical sector. Based on a number of antitrust cases
   dealt with by the European Commission, it concludes that even big and
   developed markets with a large number of independent actors, such as the
   European Union, need regulation in order to tackle anticompetitive
   agreements and behavior. In the first section of the text, major
   parameters of the industry are examined, including current production
   value, employment, labor productivity and trade figures. Additionally,
   the importance of R\&D for pharmaceutical companies is emphasized
   especially in the light of improving global competitiveness. The second
   part critically discusses several most significant antitrust
   investigations launched by the EC over the past decade. The list of
   competition law infringements include price fixing, false or misleading
   representations, abuse of a dominant position and market or customer
   allocation. The method of setting fines and offering reductions is also
   considered.
   The article highlights that the goal of these investigations is not to
   damage the economic viability of an offender but to make antitrust
   violations unprofitable and thus to prevent them. The final chapter
   stresses that companies have the right to appeal to a court against the
   decision of a competition authority. The fines imposed by the European
   Commission are reviewed by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
   There have been successful appeals, but the trend is to gradually expand
   the definition of restriction of competition. In summary, the existing
   regulation framework is necessary to promote competition and protect
   consumer rights. The EU policy on antitrust strives to strike a balance
   between the interests of original pharmaceutical companies and generic
   producers. The former are supported by patents, government subsidies and
   the demand for new treatment options; or the latter, it is crucial how
   efficiently the authorities control attempts to preserve exclusivity by
   unfair market practices since the fact that patents expire is their
   major source of income. The European experience in this area is
   especially important today when the single market for medicines in the
   Eurasian Economic Union has entered its final stage.},

Abstract = {Patent holding pharmaceutical firms are modeled as price-discriminating
   international monopolies. In an unregulated world market, firms set
   monopoly prices in each national market. Three types of regulatory
   rules: (i) `reasonable' relationship rule, (ii) international price
   comparison rule, and, (iii) therapeutic class comparison rule, are
   examined. While price regulation may lead to lower introductory prices
   for new drugs, the price of existing drugs may increase. Domestic price
   regulation may increase foreign prices-canadian data supported the
   model's predictions. Policy makers should anticipate these responses
   that affects the entire vector of drug prices and nor just those subject
   to specific regulations.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-108},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In 2017, Brazil's president faced impeachment proposals for allegedly
   receiving money from a businessman in exchange for influencing a
   decision of the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Economica (Cade), the
   Brazilian competition authority. But, considering that Cade is an
   independent agency with a reputation for transparency, how may
   politicians influence antitrust enforcement? By analysing the responses
   given to a questionnaire of mine by anonymous former Cade commissioners,
   as well as other reports related to political influence on the agency
   and records from Congress, Cade, and other institutions, this article
   will examine the channels of political influence on Cade. First, I
   examine channels of democratic control, such as the appointment process.
   Secondly, by discussing those situations in which politicians approach
   the agency, I observe that, even in the absence of an explicit promise
   or threat, contact from politicians bears a special weight for Cade's
   officers. I argue that, regardless of conclusive evidence that political
   contact or pressure has actually impacted Cade's enforcement, public
   confidence in the agency might be harmed when there is the appearance
   that it has done so. Therefore, the appropriateness of increased
   transparency surrounding meetings between elected politicians and Cade's
   officers is a matter for consideration.},

   mergers on innovation. This paper provides a comparative analysis of
   approaches to innovational competition taken by the E.U. and U.S. merger
   authorities in a sample of three recent, major, pharmaceutical mergers.
   The European Commission's approach appears lighter handed and places
   more explicit emphasis on effects in downstream markets. The
   uncertainties in the analysis of dynamic effects of mergers on
   innovation, even in pharmaceuticals, suggest the need for a cautious
   approach and for careful framing of any merger remedies where R \& D
   projects and components, rather than approved drugs, are involved.},

   Comparative Study of the Italian and UK Experiences},

Abstract = {Excessive pricing has generally been seen as a problem to be addressed
   through sector-specific regulation rather than through antitrust
   intervention. Literature on the issue is divided between scholars
   calling for an interventionist approach and those supporting a
   non-interventionist approach on the basis of conflicting rationales.
   However, recent cases have called attention to the imposition of
   excessive prices in the pharmaceutical sector. The Aspen and the Flynn
   cases, in particular, constitute emblematic examples of such practice in
   the field of off-patent drugs. The analysis of the investigations
   conducted by national competition authorities in these cases provides
   some important insights into the controversial issues of ascertaining
   when antitrust intervention can be considered justified and of
   determining which methodology may be properly adopted in order to assess
   whether a drug price is unfairly high.},

   Competition Law Antidote? Assessing Australian Pharmaceutical Antitrust
   Enforcement after ACCC v Pfizer},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The strategies employed by pharmaceutical patentees to deter generic
   entry ahead of patent expiry have been closely scrutinised by
   competition regulators in both the European Union (EU) and the United
   States (US). The decision in ACCC v Pfizer, marks the Australian
   Competition and Consumer Commission's first, albeit unsuccessful,
   attempt to test the competition law implications of a pharmaceutical
   patentee's tactics to minimise profit erosion before loss of
   exclusivity. This article critiques the ACCC v Pfizer decision, and
   discusses how the market structure of Australia's pharmaceutical and
   patent regimes provide potential incentives for anticompetitive conduct
   designed to deter generic entry. Drawing on antitrust enforcement trends
   in the EU and US, this article examines the likely competition law
   implications of ``product hopping{''} and patent settlement agreements
   (PSAs) in Australia. In considering future trends in Australian
   pharmaceutical antitrust enforcement, this article concludes that whilst
   Australia's misuse of market power prohibitions may effectively curtail
   unilateral conduct such as product hopping, there is no clear
   competition law ``antidote{''} to the anticompetitive concerns raised by
   PSAs, given the variability of such agreements.},

Abstract = {Reverse payment settlements are signed in order to delay generic entry
   on drug market regarding one particular medicine. Thus, the originator
   company can pro-long its exclusivity, with a probability of monopoly
   power. Although they give a financial compensation for the contracting
   generic companies, this agreement is detrimental for the government and
   for the patients. They need to pay for the more expensive branded drug,
   nevertheless, the patent is not valid anymore. This attitude pulls back
   the innovation, the economy and it does not help for healing illnesses
   faster either. State of California recognized the importance of ceasing

Abstract = {Antitrust law accepts the competitive marketplace, its operation, and
   its outcomes as an ideal. Society itself need not and does not. Although
   antitrust is not in the business of evaluating, for example, the
   ``fairness{''} of prices, society can, and frequently does, properly
   concern itself with these issues. When dissatisfaction results, it may
   manifest itself in an expressive boycott: a form of social campaign
   wherein purchasers express their dissatisfaction by collectively
   refusing to buy. Antitrust should neither participate in nor censor such
   normative discourse. In this Article, I explain how antitrust law
   impedes this speech, argue why it should not, and provide a framework
   that accommodates both First Amendment and antitrust values.
   The expressive boycotts this Article addresses are characterized by
   speech that is political yet also economically self-interested. The
   boycotts discussed involve scientists protesting research tool
   purveyors, doctors protesting pharmaceutical companies, and academics
   and librarians protesting for-profit publishers. The legal regimes that
   govern such undertakings, First Amendment and antitrust law, have proven
   inept in addressing this phenomenon, which lies at their intersection. I
   attribute their shortcomings to a combination of the First Amendment's
   excessive reliance upon categorization and antitrust's unduly narrow
   reliance on economic efficiency. I then craft a recommendation for
   handling these expressive boycotts that will help ensure that speech
   about the market can be as free as the market itself.},

Abstract = {Advocates of drug price restrictions in the U.S. argue that
   pharmaceutical companies operate in an unregulated market, free to
   charge whatever price the market will bear. The pharmaceutical industry
   insists that these large profits are justified for investments toward
   discovering new life saving medicines. As innovation wanes, marketing
   costs soar, and drug profits rise, public interest advocates and state
   leaders are challenging this justification. This article examines
   current problems associated with the ability to procure affordable
   medicines, and examines mounting tensions between the federal government
   and the states, particularly regarding the states' ability to negotiate
   lower prices with drug manufacturers in light of the recent Medicare
   changes. It provides a brief survey of efforts underway to secure
   affordable pharmaceuticals for state's residents, addressing the history
   and feasibility of using compulsory licensing for producing affordable
   life-saving drugs with respect to public health, constitutional, eminent
   domain, and anti-trust issues.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the price effects of generic drugs that are produced
   by brand-name drug firms and that are labeled, priced, and marketed to
   compete against independent generics. The strategy of introducing such
   ``pseudo-generics{''} - also known as ``authorized generics{''} - has
   raised some antitrust concerns. One defense of this strategy has been
   that the additional competition created by pseudo-generics should lead
   to lower prices. This paper develops a simple model to show that
   pseudo-generics can be expected to have exactly the opposite effect. It
   then examines empirical evidence on this point from the Canadian
   pharmaceutical market, showing that there appears to be a positive
   relationship between drug prices and the share of generic sales made by
   the brand's own pseudo-generic.},

Title = {BIOLOGICS: THE NEW ANTITRUST FRONTIER},
Journal = {UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-70},
Abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry lies at the intersection of patent law,
   antitrust law, federal and state regulations, and complex markets. For
   the past several decades, courts and commentators have analyzed issues
   presented by brand-name and generic drug companies in the ``small
   molecule{''} setting. But just as they have begun to comprehend the
   multiple moving parts, a new frontier has arisen involving large
   molecules known as ``biologics.{''}
   Biologics differ from small-molecule drugs along multiple axes. They are
   more expensive, costing hundreds of millions of dollars to develop. They
   cannot be precisely replicated, followed by ``biosimilars{''} rather
   than generics. They are governed not by the Hatch-Waxman Act but by the
   Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. And they present a blank
   slate on which issues of innovation and competition will be hammered out
   in the decades to come. Given that biologics promise revolutionary
   advances like treatments for previously incurable diseases and cancer
   regimens offering substantial benefits over chemotherapy, the stakes
   could not be higher.
   The small-molecule setting has been replete with collusive behavior such
   as ``reverse payment{''} agreements by which brands and generics settle
   patent litigation and unilateral conduct by which brands modify their
   drugs to block generics, file frivolous government petitions, manipulate
   the regulatory regime, and deny materials generics need to enter the
   market. How likely are these (or other) forms of conduct to appear in
   the biologics industry? And if these behaviors occur, how should
   antitrust law respond? This Article addresses these questions, offering
   an antitrust framework for the conduct most likely to arise. In
   particular, it concludes that in the biologics setting, ``citizen
   petitions,{''} the disparagement of bio-similars, and collusion between
   biologics and biosimilars will be more frequent and that ``product
   hopping{''} and reverse-payment settlements will be less typical. This
   Article also recommends utilizing an antitrust analysis similar to what
   courts have applied in the small-molecule setting and applying a
   modestly more deferential analysis for citizen petitions.
   Antitrust finds itself at a unique and crucial moment: poised at the
   precipice of a new industry but able to draw on decades of case law in
   an analogous setting that has addressed issues of competition and
   innovation. It is far from obvious how much courts can-or should-take
   from that setting. This Article assists in this task by determining
   which antitrust principles and doctrines should be exported to the
   biologics setting while appreciating the differences that counsel
   against such extrapolation. Given the importance of life-saving cancer
   treatments and an impending \$400 billion market, there is no time to
   waste.},

Journal = {B E JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \& POLICY},

Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {High prices for patented pharmaceuticals have prompted many governments
   to consider allowing competition from ``parallel imports,{''} or
   products first sold at lower prices in other countries. This paper
   examines how pharmaceutical firms have responded to changes in
   intellectual property rights and trade barriers that legalized parallel
   imports within the European Union (EU). The threat of arbitrage by
   parallel traders reduces the ability of firms to price discriminate
   across countries. Due to regulations on price and antitrust law on
   rationing supply, pharmaceutical firms may rely on non-price responses.
   Such responses include differentiation of products across countries and
   selective ``culling{''} of product lines to reduce arbitrage
   opportunities, as well as raising arbitrageurs' costs through choice of
   packaging. Using a dataset of drug prices and sales from 1993-2004
   covering 30 countries, I find evidence with attempts to reduce parallel
   trade. This may at least partially explain why parallel trade has not
   yet resulted in significant price convergence across EU countries.
   Accounting for non-price strategic responses may therefore be important
   in assessing the welfare effects of competition from parallel imports.},

Abstract = {Reverse payment agreements have long been the cause of sharp debate
   between pharmaceutical industry stakeholders as regards this fundamental
   question: what is more important within the context of Hatch-Waxman
   patent settlements patent law or competition law? As with the question,
   `what came first, the chicken or the egg?', US courts also seem to
   struggle to answer this question. However, the US Supreme Court has
   finally considered the issue and has given guidance to the lower courts.
   It held that these type of agreements are not immune from antitrust
   scrutiny and firmly rejected the settled `scope of patent' approach
   largely used by the courts, as well as the FTC's `quick look' test,
   suggesting that reverse payment agreements must be analysed under the
   antitrust `rule of reason' approach.},

Title = {SHARING, SAMPLES, AND GENERICS: AN ANTITRUST FRAMEWORK},
Journal = {CORNELL LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {103},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-63},
Abstract = {Rising drug prices are in the news. By increasing price, drug companies
   have placed vital, even life-saving, medicines out of the reach of
   consumers. In a recent development, brand firms have prevented generics
   even from entering the market. The ruse for this strategy involves
   risk-management programs known as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
   Strategies ({''}REMS{''}). Pursuant to legislation enacted in 2007, the
   FDA requires REMS when a drug's risks (such as death or injury) outweigh
   its rewards. Brands have used this regime, intended to bring drugs to
   the market, to block generic competition. Regulations such as the
   federal Hatch-Waxman Act and state substitution laws foster widespread
   generic competition. But these regimes can only be effectuated through
   generic entry. And that entry can take place only if a generic can use a
   brand's sample to show that its product is equivalent.
   More than 100 generic firms have complained that they have not been able
   to access needed samples. One study of 40 drugs subject to restricted
   access programs found that generics' inability to enter cost more than
   \$5 billion a year. Brand firms have contended that antitrust law does
   not compel them to deal with their competitors and have highlighted
   concerns related to safety and product liability in justifying their
   refusals. This Article rebuts these claims. It highlights the importance
   of samples in the regulatory regime and the FDA's inability to address
   the issue. It shows how a sharing requirement in this setting is
   consistent with Supreme Court caselaw. And it demonstrates that the
   brands' behavior fails the defendant-friendly ``no economic sense{''}
   test because the conduct literally makes no sense other than by harming
   generics.
   Brands' denial of samples offers a textbook case of monopolization. In
   the universe of pharmaceutical antitrust behavior, other conduct-such as
   ``pay for delay{''} settlements between brands and generics and
   ``product hopping{''} from one drug to a slightly modified version-has
   received the lion's share of attention. But sample denials are overdue
   for antitrust scrutiny. This Article fills this gap. Given the failure
   of Congress and the FDA to remedy the issue, antitrust can play a
   crucial role in ensuring generic access to samples, affirming a linchpin
   of the pharmaceutical regime.},

   Treatment of Pay-for-Delay Agreements},

Abstract = {With notoriously the most-expensive drug prices in the world, the United
   States has failed to use all of the tools in its shed to combat the
   unending upwards trend. One such important tool is U.S. antitrust law
   that targets companies that improperly charge monopoly and
   supracompetitive prices long past their original patent's expiration.
   Some companies have found a way to game the regulatory approval system
   by suing would-be generic competitors and then, under the guise of
   settlement, paying them to delay their market entry - allowing a brand
   drug manufacturer to maintain their monopoly prices and continue raking
   in large profits. The Actavis Supreme Court found these agreements
   involving reverse payments - also known as pay-for-delay - can violate
   antitrust laws even in light of the existing patents. This Note argues
   that in an ongoing case, In re Humira that examines reverse payments
   between biologic drug companies, the district court was right to engage
   in an Actavis analysis but did so improperly. In re Humira provides a
   prime opportunity to strengthen and clarify U.S. jurisprudence on
   reverse payments and market allocations to reduce ambiguity in an
   evolving pharmaceutical sphere: biologics and biosimilars.
   This Note further argues that to harmonize the antitrust treatment of
   pharmaceuticals - small molecule and biologic - both clear judicial
   standards and legislation are needed. This Note proceeds in four parts.
   Part II discusses various forms of antitrust abuses that arise in the
   pharmaceutical sphere and that often accompany reverse payment
   agreements. It follows with the relevant legal and regulatory
   backgrounds of small and large molecule drugs. Part III then considers
   the consequences of lax antitrust scrutiny on pharmaceuticals and
   finishes with an in-depth examination of the In re Humira litigation.
   Lastly, Part IV proposes a two-fold solution, legal and legislative, to
   the problems posed by Actavis's lack of legal clarity. Ultimately, the
   purpose of this Note is to demonstrate that the way a drug is
   manufactured, approved, or allowed to compete does not alter the
   application of antitrust law seeking to rid the market of collusive
   agreements between rivals.},

Abstract = {Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both the
   vulnerabilities and the critical role of global pharmaceutical systems
   in enabling equitable access to medicines. In this personal view, we
   position the pharmaceutical system as a missed research and investment
   opportunity that, if integrated properly, would benefit antimicrobial
   stewardship (AMS) programmes within a One Health approach.
   Key findings The pharmaceutical supply management cycle (PSMC)
   illustrates the continuous interdependence between four key phases:
   selection, procurement, distribution and use. Furthermore, a PSMC is
   subject to external forces of market competition, policy and regulation
   - across human, animal and environmental health. We present examples of
   overlap in PSMCs across different One Health sectors and discuss the
   need for integration within human, animal and environmental health
   contexts.
   Summary Despite pharmaceutical systems being fundamental to successful
   AMS programmes, they are currently neglected and undervalued. Research
   and investment into pharmaceutical system optimisation and integration
   into AMS programmes present an opportunity for both high-income
   countries and low- and middle-income countries to develop responsible,
   comparable and international AMS innovations and interventions.},

Abstract = {Some applications of Nash bargaining in the antitrust analysis of
   reverse payment settlements estimate the bargaining power parameter as
   the split of the surplus in the actual settlement with alleged reverse
   payments. This estimated parameter is then used as the bargaining power
   parameter in the but-for world where reverse payments are prohibited. We
   demonstrate that this approach is incorrect. Indeed, in the but-for
   world there could theoretically be an alternative ``no payment{''}
   settlement where reverse payments are prohibited. However, the
   prohibition on reverse payments disproportionately affects the shape of
   the bargaining set in favor of the patent holder. With this asymmetry in
   the bargaining set, the estimated ``bargaining power{''} in the actual
   world (with a settlement) no longer accurately reflects the split of the
   surplus that would have been agreed during the but-for negotiation with
   no payments. Moreover, we find that keeping the split of the surplus
   constant between the actual and but-for worlds is not innocuous because
   it overestimates the extent of alleged generic delay.},

Title = {Two puzzles resolved: Of the Schumpeter-Arrow stalemate and
   pharmaceutical innovation markets},
Journal = {IOWA LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {93},
Number = {2},
Pages = {393-450},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {One of the most heated discussions in economics in recent years has
   concerned the relationship between market structure and innovation.
   After a half-century of debate and innumerable studies, the consensus is
   that there is no clear answer to the question. On a concrete level, the
   uncertainty underlies the most fundamental critique of ``innovation
   markets, `` or markets for research and development ({''}R\&D{''}).
   After all, if concentration leads to innovation, then antitrust
   challenges are not appropriate even for mergers that lead to monopoly.
   In this Article, I closely parse the economic studies to arrive at a
   more nuanced answer that highlights factors determining the ideal market
   structure for innovation. I show that both competition and size play a
   role in pharmaceutical innovation. In addition, analysis of the
   pharmaceutical industry rebuts the most cogent critiques of innovation
   markets.
   The Article also includes the first empirical analysis of pharmaceutical
   innovation-market cases. This is particularly instructive because nearly
   every challenge to innovation-market mergers has arisen in the
   pharmaceutical industry. For each of the nine cases, I examine the
   pre-merger treatment for particular conditions, the number of
   participants in the market and stage of FDA review, and the current
   market picture. I conclude that approximately half the agency challenges
   were justified.
   Finally, I propose a new test to apply to innovation markets. The test
   examines (1) concentration among firms reasonably likely to reach the
   market, (2) anticompetitive theories of innovation suppression, and
   rebuttals based on (3) rivals' entry, (4) efficiencies, and (5) a
   ``Schumpeterian{''} need for size. The test thus replaces the current ad
   hoc approach with a comprehensive framework based on the Merger
   Guidelines. It also breaks new ground in considering not just the number
   of firms engaged in R\&D, but also the stage (both preclinical and
   clinical) of FDA review.
   The debates concerning innovation markets and the relationship between
   market structure and innovation present some of the most
   challenging,issues in economics and antitrust. MY analysis of the
   economic studies and pharmaceutical innovation-market mergers begins to
   resolve two crucial, interrelated puzzles.},

Abstract = {Paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a mechanism for the
   litigation of pharmaceutical patent infringement disputes. Many of these
   cases have been settled with reverse payments by the brand to the
   generic in return for delayed generic product entry. The Federal Trade
   Commission (FTC) has contested several of these settlements with good
   but not complete success. This paper discusses the merits of treating
   settlements that include side payments or deals that are beneficial to
   the generic as illegal per se. The paper also describes several
   additional strategies in addition to side payments, some of which raise
   serious antitrust problems, that brands have used to keep generics out
   of the market.},

Journal = {HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW},

Abstract = {The paper addresses the issue of excessive price abuse under Article
   102(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), by
   drawing inspiration from a recent stream of cases (developed first at
   the national and then at the EU level) involving pharmaceutical
   companies marketing offpatent drugs. In particular, the two `most
   advanced' cases are analysed: Aspen in Italy and Pfizer/Flynn in the
   United Kingdom. This new-found attention towards exploitative practices
   in the form of excessive and unfair pricing by dominant undertakings
   that have traditionally been subject to a cautious antitrust scrutiny
   seems worth exploring for a number of reasons, as illustrated in the
   paper. Ultimately, it is argued that this further `interference' of
   competition law into the realms of regulation may be actually justified,
   albeit subject to precise conditions for enforcement, and may pursue
   policy objectives in the wider context of EU health law.},

   research and competition advocacy takes center stage as we discuss some
   health care advocacy work in the administration of pharmaceutical

   more completely. Finally, we describe our efforts to quantify the extent

Abstract = {Reverse payments are payments that are made as a component of a patent
   infringement settlement, between a brand-name pharmaceutical company to
   a competitor who is attempting to market a generic version of the
   patented brand-name drug. The patentee not only drops its patent
   infringement suit against the generic manufacturer, but also compensates
   this alleged infringer. Reverse payment settlements raise antitrust
   concerns because they suggest that the generic manufacturer could have
   proved the brand-name's patent either invalid or non-infringed, and thus
   entered the marketplace to provide consumers with lower priced generic
   drugs, if they had continued with the litigation. This also insinuates
   that the motive behind the payment was to persuade the generic
   manufacturer to delay marketing its lower priced drug, and therefore
   prolong the brand-name company's monopoly. By settling with the generic
   manufacturer, the brand-name company is able to continue selling its
   pharmaceutical at a monopoly-set price, at the expense of consumers who
   are forced to pay higher costs for their medications.
   In FTC v. Actavis, Inc., the Supreme Court held that reverse payment
   settlements sometimes violate antitrust laws, and that each settlement
   should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, under the antitrust rule of
   reason standard, to determine if it is illegal. Under the rule of
   reason, courts must weigh the procompetitive and anticompetitive effects
   of the settlement to determine whether the payment is reasonable. The
   Supreme Court, however, declined to provide a framework for the rule of
   reason analysis of reverse payment settlements, leaving it to the lower
   courts to establish.
   Following this decision, district courts have diverged greatly in their
   application of Actavis to the reverse payment settlements before them.
   Some courts believe Actavis directs antitrust scrutiny only to
   settlements involving monetary payment, while others believe the holding
   also applies to noncash settlements. This Note argues that Actavis
   antitrust scrutiny should be applied not only to monetary settlements,
   but also to nonmonetary settlements, because reverse payments can bring
   a risk of significant anticompetitive effects regardless of the
   particular form of the transfer of value. Additionally, this Note
   proposes a model of analysis to apply when determining whether the terms
   of a nonmonetary settlement violate antitrust law.},

Title = {A Machete for the Patent Thicket: Using Noerr-Pennington Doctrine's Sham
   Exception to Challenge Abusive Patent Tactics by Pharmaceutical
   Companies},

Abstract = {Outrageous drug prices have dominated news coverage of the American
   healthcare system for years. Yet despite widespread condemnation of
   skyrocketing drug prices, nothing seems to change. Pharmaceutical
   companies can raise drug prices with impunity because they hold patents
   on their drugs, which give them monopolies. These monopolies are only
   supposed to last twenty years, and then competing lower-cost drugs like
   generics can enter the market, driving down the costs of pharmaceuticals
   for all. But pharmaceutical companies have created ``patent
   thickets,{''} dense webs of overlapping patents surrounding one drug,
   which have artificially extended the companies' monopolies for years or
   even decades after a drug's initial patent expires. These problems will
   only be exacerbated as the pharmaceutical industry increasingly focuses
   on biologic drugs, which already provide more opportunities to acquire
   multiple patents on one drug than traditional small-molecule drugs.
   Patent law's weapons in the fight against patent thickets, namely
   litigation and inter partes reviews (an abbreviated process for
   challenging patent validity), have proven to be inadequate a scalpel
   when the public needs a machete. Antitrust law, which polices
   anticompetitive behavior and corrects market failures, is the ideal
   weapon to fight the pharmaceutical industry's exploitation of patent
   law. The Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which immunizes parties from
   antitrust liability when a party ``petitions{''} the government,
   currently stands in the way of an antitrust solution to the
   patent-thicket problem. ``Petitions{''} eligible for Noerr-Pennington
   antitrust immunity include patent applications and patent-infringement
   lawsuits, so the pharmaceutical industry can wield the Noerr-Pennington
   doctrine as a sword against potential antitrust challenges. The
   Noerr-Pennington doctrine has a narrow ``sham exception,{''} where
   Noerr-Pennington antitrust immunity is pierced when a party's petitions
   are ``mere shams{''} to interfere with the operations of a competitor.
   Unfortunately, after two Supreme Court decisions about the sham
   exception, the circuit courts have disagreed on the sham exception's
   operation, leaving potential antitrust plaintiffs, such as consumers and
   government regulators, with uncertain prospects for challenging patent
   thickets under antitrust law.
   This Note proposes that courts adopt an approach to reconcile the
   Supreme Court decisions wherein courts apply a stricter standard for
   invoking the sham exception when an antitrust plaintiff challenges a
   single sham petition and a looser standard when an antitrust plaintiff
   challenges a pattern of sham petitions. Further, this Note proposes a
   general framework for analyzing patent proceedings under the looser
   pattern standard. This solution strikes a balance between protecting
   parties' First Amendment petitioning right and discouraging abuse of the
   patent law system for anticompetitive effect. If successful, antitrust
   challenges can lead to quicker market entry for lower-cost drugs and
   allow more people to benefit from innovative and life-altering drugs.},

Abstract = {The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) is a recently-formed division
   of the Patent Office in which patents can be challenged as invalid, and
   which differs from federal courts in a number of respects. We
   investigate whether monopolist-patentees and their prospective rivals
   are using the PTAB which has not previously received antitrust attention
   as a platform for striking settlements that delay the rivals' entry.
   Such settlements are common in pharmaceutical markets, and are typically
   antitrust violations in cases where the patentee pays the challenger
   ({''}pay for delay{''}). However, problematic statutory inducements lead
   to excessively-delayed competition even in lieu of such payments. Our
   empirical findings suggest that delayed entry settlements are now
   commonly executed in the PTAB, and that they comprise a large majority
   of all PTAB settlements reached between pharmaceutical rivals. Further,
   nearly half of the delayed entry settlements were reached after the
   relevant patent claims were deemed ``reasonably likely{''} to be
   invalid. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This Article examines the problem of ``reverse payment{''} settlements
   in patent litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act. A reverse payment
   settlement involves a payment from a branded pharmaceutical company to a
   generic manufacturer, usually in return for the generic manufacturer's
   agreement to delay market entry. Federal appellate courts, regulatory
   agencies, and commentators are divided about the legality of such
   agreements under antitrust law. This Article argues that the importance
   of product market definition has been overlooked in existing treatments
   of the issue. The Article develops an empirically based ``Settlement
   Competition Index{''} that could be used by courts and regulatory
   agencies to evaluate reverse payment settlements. A formula to calculate
   the Settlement Competition Index is provided and tested with
   hypothetical and real-world examples.},

Title = {Limiting Pharmaceutical Parallel Trade in the European Union: Regulatory
   and Economic Justifications},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {This article sheds light on the economic and regulatory reasons for not
   holding limitations of pharmaceutical parallel trade within the European
   Union as unlawful per se. It traces the different regulatory systems
   applied by EU Member States, and explains how this variety increases the
   levels of parallel trade. Moreover, it analyses the size and nature of
   pharmaceutical R \& D costs, and briefly describes alternative means of
   protecting R \& D investment, other than limitations of parallel trade.
   Furthermore, the welfare effects of parallel trade are analysed. The way
   that the Court of Justice and the General Court have dealt with
   limitations of pharmaceutical parallel trade in landmark cases, and the
   relevant economic justifications advanced, are also presented. Finally,
   the article deals with the constitutional issue of whether the principle
   of market integration should be prioritised over consumer welfare in the
   context of the Treaty of Functioning of the European Union.},

Number = {4},

Abstract = {There is growing concern over the pharmaceutical industry's ability to
   set and raise drug prices as it sees fit. The price of a drug that has
   not been protected by a patent for decades can suddenly increase-or
   ``ratchet{''}-as much as 10,000\%. This Note identifies the problem of
   ratcheting drug prices and considers whether these abrupt changes in
   drug prices derive from a longstanding problem inherent in the United
   States' pharmaceutical regulatory regime. It then considers the most
   commonly suggested mechanism for countering high drug prices-stimulating
   competition in the pharmaceutical market-but ultimately concludes that
   focusing solely on increasing competition constructs an overly
   simplistic view of ratcheting drug prices. In order to find an effective
   solution to unexpected increases in drug prices, this Note evaluates a
   small subset of pharmaceuticals that have recently undergone a sudden
   price increase and separates the ratcheting events into two categories:
   (1) those that occur as a result of natural deviations in the market,
   and (2) those that occur due to business tactics that take advantage of
   vulnerabilities in the drug market. It concludes that under this
   categorization, antitrust law may provide an effective solution
   specifically directed at ratcheting events of the second category-those
   driven by anticompetitive behavior.},

Abstract = {Much attention in the antitrust world has been focused on efforts by
   brand drug manufacturers to delay or deter generic entry into the
   pharmaceutical markets following these brand drugs' loss of patent
   exclusivity. Scholars have recounted and criticized recent exclusionary
   techniques by brand drug manufacturers, including pay-fordelay (or
   reverse-payment settlement) agreements, noncash pay-for-delay
   agreements, and product hopping. These efforts, while successful in
   stymieing generic entry into the prescription drug market, have largely
   been struck down by courts as anticompetitive in a series of recent
   decisions. In light of these decisions, a key, but underanalyzed,
   concern now is that in order to keep generics out of the market, or at
   least delay their entry, brand manufacturers will turn to a new tactic:
   predatory pricing using authorized generics. While some scholarly
   attention was paid to authorized generics in the early 2000s, almost
   none has been given since the Supreme Court held unlawful brand drug
   manufacturers' other main exclusionary tactics, despite the fact that
   the time is now ripe for the launch of authorized generics. Given that
   courts have already permitted a brand manufacturer's launch of an
   authorized generic during a first-filer generic's exclusivity period,
   brand manufacturers could deter generic entry by launching an authorized
   generic upon the start of the first filer's exclusivity period but
   pricing the authorized generic below the generic's costs, thereby
   preventing the generic from recouping its substantial entry costs.
   Eventually, if generics see a pattern of brands launching authorized
   generics during the first filer's period of exclusivity, generics may be
   deterred from entering the market at all before patent expiration,
   thereby depriving consumers of price competition in the pharmaceutical
   market, resulting in higher drug prices overall.
   The problem, however, is that if brand manufacturers are in fact pricing
   their authorized generics below the generic manufacturers' costs in
   order to deter generic entry, it is unduly difficult to hold the brand
   manufacturers accountable under the Supreme Court's current predatory
   pricing doctrine. Its test, as enunciated in Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown
   \& Williamson Tobacco Corp., only imposes liability if a predator prices
   below some measure of its own costs and if there is a reasonable
   probability that the predator will recoup its initial investment in low
   prices. This Note provides a new analysis that better accounts for the
   unique regulatory structure and patent protection of the prescription
   drug market. It argues that a test based on limit pricing, or pricing
   below the entrant's costs, would more effectively address this
   exclusionary conduct that harms consumers.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, drug makers have settled patent litigation. by
   making large payments to potential rivals who, in turn, abandon suits
   that (if successful) would increase competition. Because such
   ``pay-for-delay{''} settlements postpone the possibility of competitive
   entry, they have attracted the attention of antitrust enforcement
   authorities, courts, and commentators. Pay-for-delay settlements not
   only constitute a problem of immense practical importance in antitrust
   enforcement, but also pose a general dilemma about the proper balance
   between innovation and consumer access. This Article examines the
   pay-for-delay dilemma as a problem in regulatory design. A full analysis
   of the relevant industry-specific regulatory statute, the Hatch-Waxman
   Act, yields two conclusions. First, certain features of the Act widen,
   often by subtle means, the potential for anticompetitive harm from
   pay-for-delay settlements. Second, the Act reflects a congressional
   judgment favoring litigated challenges, contrary to arguments employed
   to justify these settlements. These results support the further
   conclusion that pay-for-delay settlements are properly condemned as
   unreasonable restraints of trade. This analysis illustrates two
   mechanisms by which an industry-specific regulatory regime shapes the
   scope of antitrust liability: by creating (or limiting) opportunities
   for anticompetitive conduct as a practical economic matter, and by
   guiding as a legal matter the vigor of antitrust enforcement in
   addressing that conduct.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the legality of reverse payment patent settlement
   agreements (RPPSAs) in the pharmaceutical industry has become a
   contentious issue and attracted the attention of antitrust authorities
   in many countries. It is a sophisticated intersection of patent
   protection - encouraging research and development in the pharmaceutical
   industry - and competition enforcement - maintaining fair and effective
   competition in the relevant market. Given the complexities, there is no
   unanimous approach adopted to deal with the compatibility of such RPPSAs
   with antitrust law. As China's legal and economic context has changed
   considerably, there will be great possibility that such RPPSAs will also
   appear in China. However, there has not been an effective anti-monopoly
   analysis framework established that focuses on regulating such RPPSAs in
   China. Therefore, this article proposes that China should prepare itself
   in advance from two perspectives. On the one hand, a competition inquiry
   should be conducted in China's pharmaceutical industry to evaluate the
   development of RPPSAs; on the other hand, a basic analysis approach
   should be confirmed in the forthcoming anti-monopoly guidelines for
   intellectual property rights (IPRs). This article proposes that the
   anti-monopoly scrutiny should mainly focus on the patent settlement
   agreements with value transfer from a brand-name drug company to a
   generic one in exchange for the latter's commitment to delay market
   entry. Then, China's Anti-monopoly Law should be applied differently on
   the basis of the timing at which the generic drugs are permitted to
   enter the market. Finally, this article provides some important and
   typical factors of RPPSAs that should be examined carefully.},

Abstract = {Economists at the Federal Trade Commission pursue the agency's
   competition and consumer protection missions. In this year's essay, in
   antitrust, we discuss two recent mergers that involved Rx drugs: First,
   we describe key elements of the inquiry into the Express Scripts/Medco
   transaction in the pharmacy benefit management industry. Next, we
   analyze a merger that involved drugs that are used to treat patent
   ductus arteriosus: a condition that affects premature babies. On the
   consumer protection side, we discuss a pricing strategy-drip
   pricing-that involves the release of price information about a
   multi-part product over time as the consumer goes through the purchase
   process.},

Title = {The Antitrust Implications of Filing ``Sham{''} Citizen Petitions with
   the FDA},
Journal = {HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {65},

Pages = {113-152},

Abstract = {The First Amendment protects the right of all citizens to petition the
   government. The Food and Drug Administration (the ``FDA{''}) has
   provided a means by which citizens or interested entities can voice
   their concerns to the FDA by filing a so-called ``citizen petition.{''}
   However, some brand-name pharmaceutical companies have abused this
   process by filing baseless petitions with the FDA in an effort to delay
   generic competition. Such anticompetitive activity is generally
   protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which grants antitrust
   immunity to activity that involves petitioning the government for
   redress. However, the immunity does not apply to ``sham{''} petitions,
   the main objective of which is to cause anticompetitive harm through the
   process, rather than the outcome, of a petition. The citizen petition
   process has provided a number of examples of likely sham petitions,
   resulting in delayed generic entry into the market. In some cases, such
   delay has resulted in billions of dollars in extra profits for
   brand-name manufacturers submitting ``sham{''} petitions, at the expense
   of consumers and generic manufacturers.
   This Article analyzes recent cases in which plaintiffs allege that the
   citizen petitions aim to delay generic entry, and suggests precautions
   that practitioners can take in such lawsuits. It proposes a variety of
   changes to FDA regulations, as well as additions to judicial doctrines,
   to curb the problems caused by sham petitions. It also serves as a guide
   to brand-name manufacturers who wish to avoid liability under the
   ``sham{''} exception. These proposals may become more relevant as the
   rate of filing citizen petitions grows and more generic drug
   applications accrue in the FDA's backlog.},

Title = {Playing Both Sides? Branded Sales, Generic Drugs, and Antitrust Policy},

Abstract = {The issue of high drug prices has recently exploded into public
   consciousness. And while many potential explanations have been offered,
   one has avoided scrutiny. Why has the growth in generic drugs not
   resulted in lower drug prices?
   In this Article, we explore a phenomenon we call ``playing both
   sides{''}: companies that participate in pharmaceutical markets as both
   brand owners and generics. We hypothesize that companies that earn a
   significant amount of their revenue from patented drugs may have less
   incentive to aggressively pursue a generic agenda, since patented drugs
   generate far more revenue than generic drugs do.
   To investigate this phenomenon, we built a comprehensive database of all
   major pharmaceutical companies, evaluating where their revenue comes
   from, how that has changed over time, and how it relates to their
   behavior in court. Despite broad industry trends toward specialization,
   about one third of the firms we study have opted for a mixed business
   model over time. Those firms behave differently than pure generic firms.
   Our data shows that when companies with significant generic sales play
   both sides, they behave differently than firms with a purer generic
   revenue stream. Dollar for dollar, the pure generic firms in our study
   challenged more patents as invalid or not infringed than the mixed
   firms. Further, ``mixed generic{''} companies with growing brand sales
   (or a growing share of their revenue from brand sales) are more likely
   to settle the patent challenges they bring; companies with growing
   generic share are more likely to take those cases to judgment. And when
   they do go to judgment, patent challengers with a greater generic share
   are more likely to win those challenges.
   In short, we find evidence to support the hypothesis that generic
   companies that make more of their revenue from patented drugs are less
   likely to pursue challenges to judgment and less likely to win when they
   do. Playing both sides may reduce the incentive of generic challengers
   to fight as hard as possible to win the case before them. That may be
   especially true of the sorts of challenges that affect not just the
   patent in the instant case but might change legal doctrines that may
   ultimately hurt the generic challenger's brand business.
   Our Article's findings suggest a more nuanced antitrust analysis of
   mergers involving generic companies and patent settlements in which
   generics delay entering the market. In challenging more patents,
   settling fewer cases by agreeing to delay entry, and winning more of the
   cases they do bring, pure generic companies promise to unleash the
   generic competition that they were intended to. In the wide-ranging
   effort to lower drug prices, we must pay attention not only to whether a
   drug is patented but also to who is, or is not, challenging that patent
   and why.},

Abstract = {Within the tool-box developed by originator companies in order to
   prepare and respond to generic entry, a prominent position must be
   recognized to a category of patent strategies particularly controversial
   under antitrust scrutiny, i.e. patent settlement agreements, in
   particular in the form of reverse payment patent settlements (also
   called pay-for-delay settlements), due to the fact that they provide for
   the patentee to pay the alleged infringer, rather than the opposite,
   with the aim of delaying its market entry. It is a fact that reverse
   payment settlement agreements arise mainly in the pharmaceutical
   industry. The article firstly analyses US and EU regulatory frameworks
   in order to highlight similarities and differences between them. Then,
   it examines the relevant case law in both contexts with a view to
   conducting a comparative study. Finally, the article discusses the
   approaches to reverse payment patent settlements adopted by antitrust
   authorities and courts and their clashes with intellectual property law,
   and contains a final proposal for the assessment of these agreements.},

Abstract = {This paper derives necessary and sufficient conditions for compulsory
   licensing to increase consumer surplus and total welfare, taking into
   account both static (technology transfer) and dynamic (innovation)
   effects. When the risk-free rate is low, compulsory licensing is shown
   unambiguously to increase consumer surplus. Compulsory licensing has an
   ambiguous effect on total welfare, but is more likely to increase total
   welfare in industries that are naturally less competitive. Finally,
   compulsory licensing is shown to be an effective policy to protect
   competition per se. The paper also demonstrates the robustness of these
   results to alternative settings of R\&D competition and discusses their
   significance for the debate on compulsory licensing in the context of
   standard-setting organisations and pharmaceutical trade.},

Abstract = {This article reviews the recent literature on the so-called
   ``pay-for-delay agreements,{''} a form of patent dispute settlement
   agreement in which a generic manufacturer acknowledges the patent of an
   originator pharmaceutical company and agrees to refrain from marketing
   its generic product for a specific period of time. In return, the
   generic company receives a consideration in the form of a payment from
   the originator. After a presentation of the evaluation grid that is made
   of these agreements combining intellectual property and competition
   issues, we examine to which extent the use by the competition
   authorities of a truncated analysis based on the size of payments really
   helps to shed light on the most likely anti-competitive agreements or,
   conversely, if this is equivalent to the way a drunk uses a lamppost,
   namely for support rather than illumination.},

   Pharmaceutical Patents},

Abstract = {Many advocates for using compulsory licensing (CL) for pharmaceutical
   patents in developing countries like Thailand rest their case in part on
   the purported use of CL in the United States. In this Article we take
   issue with that proposition on several grounds. As a textual matter, the
   ``commercially reasonable terms{''} language in Article 31 of TRIPS,
   even when qualified by the Doha declaration, prevents any host nation
   from using whatever royalties it wants in its CL arrangements,
   especially those that are below marginal cost. As a theoretical matter,
   we argue that the basic presumption in favor of voluntary licenses for
   intellectual property (IP) should apply in the international arena, in
   addition to the domestic one. In the international context, voluntary
   licenses are of special importance because they strengthen the supply
   chain for distributing pharmaceuticals and ease the government
   enforcement of safety standards. Next, this Article analyzes several of
   the key illustrations of purported CL for drug patents in the United
   States and shows that the use of CL elsewhere deviates in material ways
   from the standard US practices. These are the compulsory copyright
   licenses for music, the limited statutory exemptions for pharmaceuticals
   and medical procedures, the award of damages instead of injunctions
   after eBay Inc v MercExchange, LLC, government takings, and the use of
   compulsory licenses in antitrust settlements. Whatever the ultimate
   desirability of these American doctrines, none of them seeks to reduce
   the payment on licenses to the marginal cost of the licensed goods. Any
   need to help poor people gain access to vital drugs should not rely on
   CL, but instead should rely on tools precisely aimed at that purpose,
   including direct government purchases of patented drugs from their
   manufacturers at negotiated prices.},

Title = {DRUG WARS: A NEW GENERATION OF GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL DELAY},
Journal = {HARVARD JOURNAL ON LEGISLATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {2},
Pages = {499-561},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {Thirty years ago, Congress ushered in a new and miraculous era in
   medicine with the creation of the Hatch-Waxman system for approval of
   generic drugs. The progress, however, has not been without resistance.
   This Article presents an overview of three generations of games
   pharmaceutical companies play to keep generics off the market and
   maintain monopoly pricing. In ``Generation 1.0,{''} branded companies
   simply pay generics to delay entering the market, reaping billions of
   dollars of benefit. ``Generation 2.0{''} involves paying for delay
   through multiple side deals that camouflage the value of the payment.
   Generation 2.0 also includes what this Article refers to as ``boy scout
   clauses{''} agreements to behave honorably that actually mask
   anticompetitive collusion. The newest generation, however, moves from
   collusion to obstruction. Generation 3.0 uses administrative processes,
   regulatory schemes, and drug modifications to prevent generics from
   getting to market. Some of these schemes have now made the news as
   debates rage over pharmaceutical pricing.
   Society, however, cannot necessarily blame companies for engaging in
   behavior that is strongly in their economic self-interest. One cannot
   expect mice to run in the appropriate direction if the cheese is located
   at the other end. Thus, this Article's goals are two-fold: first, to
   shine light on the complex behaviors as they are unfolding, and second,
   to explore the contours of how new approaches could be structured. To
   paraphrase one former FDA commissioner, we do not want the most creative
   activity at pharmaceutical companies to take place in the legal
   department. And after thirty years of experience with Hatch-Waxman, it
   is time for the next phase.},

Abstract = {The patent system fosters innovation by granting the right to exclude.
   Since a rightsholder can legally suppress competition and charge
   monopoly prices, a patent provides a type of antitrust immunity. Even
   when firms allegedly abuse their exclusive rights through the creation
   of patent thickets, meritless infringement litigation, or breaching
   one's FRAND commitment, courts and federal agencies have concluded that
   antitrust is ill-equipped to discipline patent practices. Without
   antitrust remedies, firms have banded together against rightsholders to
   negotiate for better terms. Their strategies have included boycotting
   abusive patentees, as well as collectively negotiating against them. By
   using self-help remedies, they seek to pay fair rates for only the
   patents needed for their technology. This type of cooperation may
   ideally foster competition and innovation where patent abuses undermine
   both goals. The problem is, ironically, that combining against a
   monopolist is likely anticompetitive. Antitrust condemns collusion to
   manipulate prices-here, licensing rates-even when done against a
   monopolist. This renders a troubling outcome where ``Big Pharma,{''}
   ``Big Tech,{''} and others can insulate their monopoly power using the
   very laws meant to condemn monopolies. While debate has emerged about
   patent abuses, an equally salient issue involves whether antitrust
   should condemn firms who collude against patent holders and monopolists.
   Using economic and historical evidence, this Article argues that
   antitrust law should allow firms to defend an antitrust claim by citing
   their rival's market power. Our models show that powerful rightsholders
   do, in fact, harm competition and innovation in ways not meant to
   protect original technology. We then find that the benefits of collusion
   among smaller firms were advanced by the Sherman Act's drafters, whose
   comments are critical to shaping and understanding modern antitrust.
   Support even comes from the labor arena: Congress excluded workers from
   antitrust law-as labor unions were once considered a form of
   collusion-so that workers could counterbalance their employers'
   dominance with their own market power. As such, given the practical and
   theoretical difficulties of remedying anticompetitive abuses of patent
   rights under the antitrust laws, we assert that taking antitrust out of
   patent law would allow competition to flourish in dynamic markets while
   enhancing the patent system's incentives to innovate.},

Volume = {96},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In a recent policy reversal, the Department of Justice has, for the
   first time, pursued antitrust liability for ``reverse payment{''}
   settlements. These settlements occur in the pharmaceutical industry when
   brand-name and generic drug companies settle patent-infringement
   litigation. In a reverse-payment settlement, the generic drug company
   agrees not to enter the market for some period of time and the patent
   holder agrees to give it something of value-often quarterly cash
   payments. The DOJ claims that such settlements should be analyzed under
   the rule of reason but in fact seeks an unwarranted presumption that
   reverse payments are unreasonably anticompetitive. At first glance,
   reverse-payment settlements do seem bad they resemble anticompetitive
   market-division arrangements where one party pays another to stay out of
   the market. However, this Article's more context-specific economic
   analysis reveals that the effects of reverse payments are not obvious,
   can be procompetitive, and that a presumption of anticompetitive effect
   is thus unwarranted. Instead, courts should analyze them under the
   traditional rule of reason with no presumption for or against such
   settlements.},

Title = {R\&D competition and the direction of innovation {*}},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {82},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We propose a model to show that when innovation in a given field becomes
   more lucrative, its direction can be distorted even though its rate
   rises. Higher payoffs attract innovators, making the R\&D supply side
   more competitive. This competition endogenously shifts effort toward
   less promising but quicker-to-invent projects. We empirically quantify
   the magnitude of this distortion, in the context of pharmaceutical
   innovation during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the social planner solution,
   74 percent more firms would have worked on vaccines and 17 percent more
   on novel compounds. Policy remedies include advance purchase commitments
   based on ex-ante value, targeted research subsidies, and antitrust
   exemptions for joint research ventures. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Pharmaceutical M\&As in emerging markets may jeopardize cheap access to
   generics. This may be a motivation for policy makers to use competition
   law as a tool to deter cross-border M\&As. Additionally, while M\&As in
   the pharmaceutical sector may give rise to certain efficiencies, it is
   not clear how efficiencies will be treated in the peculiar
   socio-economic context of emerging markets. This article develops a
   theoretical framework that argues that the application of competition
   law is guided by sector-specific socio-economic realities and
   institutional realities of the jurisdiction. Thereafter, it employs this
   framework to analyze the issues of access to generics and efficiencies
   of production.},

Abstract = {This article evaluates the effect on competition of adopting the FTC's
   product hopping theory as an antitrust doctrine. Courts have disagreed
   on the merits of the theory. According to this theory, a pharmaceutical
   manufacturer of a brand name drug can violate the antitrust laws by
   introducing a new product that reduces demand for rival legacy generic
   therapies and offers consumers no significant incremental therapeutic
   benefits over these legacy products. Under these circumstances, generic
   manufacturers are harmed because they lose sales to the new product and
   consumers are also harmed, because while they gain no significant
   therapeutic benefits from the new product they must pay a higher price.
   The FTC has applied the theory to the pharmaceutical industry because,
   in the FTC's view, the purpose of product hopping is to evade aspects of
   the Hatch-Waxman Act which was designed to promote competition between
   generics and brand name drugs. Although the FTC so far has applied the
   theory only to pharmaceuticals, nothing in the theory limits its
   application only to the drug industry. The article explains that the
   theory is at best a misguided attempt to use antitrust law to fix a
   regulatory problem in the pharmaceutical industry associated with the
   Hatch-Waxman Act and is premised on the proposition that competition
   does not work. Using antitrust law to fix such a regulatory problem,
   assuming one indeed exists, will not only potentially make things worse
   in pharmaceutical markets, but also create an undesirable antitrust
   precedent for other industries.},

Abstract = {Bundled loyalty discounts are considered exclusionary whenever an
   equally efficient competitor in the competitive (tied) market cannot
   earn a profit while compensating the buyer for forgone discounts on the
   monopolized (tying) product. This discount attribution standard has been
   applied in cases involving share-based loyalty rebates for a single
   product; in those cases, the contestable portion of demand plays the
   role of the tied product, and the non-contestable portion constitutes
   the tying product. Economists have developed an alternative test that
   predicts the impact on consumer welfare by comparing the standalone
   price of the tying product to the profit-maximizing price that would
   prevail the absence of the bundled (or share-based) rebate. Economists
   have proposed to implement this test by comparing the price of the tying
   good before and after the implementation of the loyalty rebate. We
   propose a framework that builds on these concepts, expanding the
   analysis to model fluctuations in market conditions. In a review of
   three recent cases in the pharmaceutical industry, we find that
   comparisons based on a simple before-after approach are often clouded by
   confounding factors. By explicitly modeling shifts in demand and cost
   structures, our proposed framework provides a more robust mechanism for
   applying these consumer-welfare-based tests.},

Title = {Should Pay for Delay Be a Cause for Concern in Japan?},
Journal = {WORLD COMPETITION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {163-183},
Abstract = {Yes, it should. Pay for delay settlements have raised concern across the
   globe and have led to significant competition law scrutiny in the US and
   Europe. Branded pharmaceutical companies use patent settlements to pay
   potential generic entrants in order to stay off the market, thereby
   reducing competition and harming consumers. This conduct has been found
   to be unlawful by the US Supreme Court and the EU General Court. In
   Japan, however, such anticompetitive settlements allegedly do not take
   place, despite offering similar economic incentives to pharmaceutical
   companies in the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world. This
   is intriguing and warrants close scrutiny. This article is the first to
   investigate, based on a comparative analysis with the US and EU whether
   or not the Japanese pharmaceutical sector is susceptible to pay for
   delay settlements. We come to the conclusion that the regulatory regime
   in Japan features the necessary prerequisites to make pay for delay
   settlements a feasible yet anticompetitive drug lifecycle management
   strategy.},

Abstract = {The Supreme Court ruled in FTC v. Actavis that a delay in generic entry
   may be anticompetitive when part of a patent settlement includes a large
   and otherwise unjustified value transfer to the generic company, termed
   a reverse payment patent settlement, or ``pay-for-delay.{''} Following
   Actavis, drug companies have limited the size of reverse payments and
   have fashioned settlement terms that include more discreet categories of
   compensation to generic companies. In light of the fact that such
   settlements retain the potential for anticompetitive effects, the
   apparent size of the reverse payment may no longer be a useful gauge of
   the legality of pay-for-delay deals. In this Article, we argue that
   convoluted settlements in the post-Actavis landscape that camouflage
   value transfers from brand-name to generic companies necessitate a shift
   in the focus of antitrust scrutiny to the existence of any restriction
   on generic entry, together with a category of patent less likely to
   survive a challenge. We conclude with a discussion of pay-for-delay
   bills in the 116th Congress and propose several reforms to deter
   pay-for-delay behavior.},

Abstract = {Competition among generics helps keep drug prices low and control
   medical costs. Good estimates of the effect on price of the entry of
   another generic competitor would inform competition policy and test
   oligopoly theories. However, identifying the causal effect of entry is
   difficult since the number of firms that compete in a market is
   endogenously determined. We exploit provisions of the 1984 Hatch-Waxman
   Act to identify a causal effect. We find that ignoring endogenous
   selection into generic drug markets imparts a significant downward bias
   to the estimates of the effects of two and three competitors on generic
   drug prices.},

Abstract = {The impact of parallel trade on innovation in R\&D-intensive industries,
   such as pharmaceuticals, is a hotly debated question in antitrust and IP
   policy. The well-known argument that parallel trade dampens innovation
   by undermining firms' ability to price discriminate has been challenged
   by recent literature. The argument is that with endogenous price
   controls, parallel trade increases innovation by reducing governments'
   incentives to set particularly low price caps. In this paper, we show
   that this result crucially depends on the degree of homogeneity of the
   trading countries. The result only holds if consumers in poorer
   countries have a relatively similar demand for medication as consumers
   in richer countries. Instead, when countries are relatively
   heterogeneous, parallel trade dampens innovation and lowers welfare by
   exporting price cap regulation from poorer to richer countries. These
   findings are in line with recent case evidence. We also show that when
   patent length is endogenous, richer countries will tend to choose longer
   patent protection with parallel trade, whereas equilibrium price caps
   tend to be tighter in that case. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The application of competition law to the pharmaceutical sector is
   complicated, and it is a difficult task for courts and competition
   agencies to determine whether a certain business practice in the
   industry results in a violation of competition law. In particular the
   topic of reverse payment agreements is challenging in most competition
   jurisdictions, as it is deeply related to intellectual property (IP) law
   and policy. IP and competition policymakers often try to establish
   criteria for assessing this practice, and there has been recent
   noteworthy case law from courts in various jurisdictions. Courts in the
   United States and the Republic of Korea have recently issued their first
   judgments on reverse payment agreements. Although there is no
   significant court judgment in the European Union, the Commission has
   also made its first decision on a reverse payment agreement. This
   article therefore aims to discuss recent developments in competition law
   and policy on reverse payments in diverse jurisdictions through a
   comparative study.},

Abstract = {In paragraph iv pharmaceutical cases, a patent-litigation decision often
   determines whether a brand-firm monopoly continues or generic entry
   occurs. Using unique patent-litigation data and an event-study approach
   that accounts for probabilistic district court decisions and an
   appellate process, we estimate that brand-firm stakes in such cases
   average \$4.3 billion while generic-firm stakes average \$204.3 million.
   After theSchering-Plough v. FTCdecision in 2002 that upheld a settlement
   in which the brand firm paid the generic firm in return for delayed
   entry, we find that settlement is more likely and stakes are
   significantly lower, despite greater average brand sales for the drugs
   in the cases. On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that
   pay-for-delay settlements led to less within-market competition after
   2002.},

Abstract = {The article begins by laying out a simple framework that makes obvious
   the incentives at play in generic drug entry, brand challenges, and
   settlements between the two. Once this common understanding has been
   established, several rule changes that have taken place are
   summarized-one in the form of an amendment to Hatch-Waxman and another
   in a recent decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
   These institutional changes may have the consequence of reducing the
   prevalence of reverse payments. This possibility suggests a different
   policy tact might be called for, one that shifts emphasis from
   determining whether or not reverse payments should be per se illegal to
   working with the incentives that firms already face and exploiting those
   incentives to reduce firms' inclinations to enter into anticompetitive
   reverse-payment settlements.},

Title = {PRODUCT HOPPING: A NEW FRAMEWORK},
Journal = {NOTRE DAME LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {92},
Number = {1},
Pages = {167-230},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {One of the most misunderstood and anticompetitive business behaviors in
   today's economy is ``product hopping,{''} which occurs when a brand-name
   pharmaceutical company switches from one version of a drug to another.
   These switches, benign in appearance but not necessarily in effect, can
   significantly decrease consumer welfare, impairing competition from
   generic drugs to an extent that greatly exceeds any gains from the
   ``improved{''} branded product.
   The antitrust analysis of product hopping is nuanced. It implicates the
   intersection of antitrust law, patent law, the Hatch-Waxman Act, and
   state drug product selection laws. In fact, the behavior is even more
   complex because it occurs in uniquely complicated markets characterized
   by doctors who choose the product but don't pay for it, and consumers
   who buy the product but don't choose it.
   It is thus unsurprising that courts have offered inconsistent approaches
   to product hopping. They have paid varying levels of attention to the
   regulatory structure, offered a simplistic analysis of consumer choice,
   adopted an underinclusive antitrust standard based on coercion, and
   focused on, whether the brand firm removed the original drug from the
   market.
   Entering this morass, we offer a new framework that courts, government
   enforcers, plaintiffs, and manufacturers can employ to analyze product
   hopping. This rigorous and balanced framework is the first to
   incorporate the economic characteristics of the pharmaceutical industry.
   For starters, it defines a ``product hop{''} to include only those
   instances in which the brand manufacturer (1) reformulates the product
   in a way that makes the generic non-substitutable and (2) encourages
   doctors to write prescriptions for the reformulated product rather than
   the original. The test also offers two safe harbors, which are more
   deferential than current caselaw, to ensure that the vast majority of
   reformulations will not be subject to antitrust scrutiny.
   The analysis then examines whether a brand's product hop passes the
   ``no-economic-sense{''} test. In other words, would the reformulation
   make economic sense for the brand if it did not have the effect of
   impairing generic competition? Merely introducing new products would
   pass the test. Encouraging doctors to write prescriptions for the
   reformulated rather than the original product ``cannibalizing{''} the
   brand's own sales might not. Imposing antitrust liability on behavior
   that does not make business sense other than through its impairment of
   generic competition offers a conservative approach and minimizes ``false
   positives{''} in which courts erroneously find liability. Showing just
   how far the courts have veered from justified economic analysis, the
   test would recommend a different analysis than that used in each of the
   five product-hopping cases that have been litigated to date, and a
   different outcome in two of them.
   By carefully considering the regulatory environment, practicalities of
   prescription drug markets, manufacturers' desire for clear-cut rules,
   and consumers' needs for a rule that promotes price competition without
   deterring valued innovations, the framework promises to improve and
   standardize the antitrust analysis of product hopping.},

Abstract = {The Hatch-Waxman Act, a piece of legislation that seeks to foster
   generic competition for brand-name pharmaceuticals, has led to the
   troubling practice of reverse-payment settlements. In such settlements,
   the brand-name company pays the generic company a sum of money to delay
   the generic's entry into the market. Thus, the settlements raise
   antitrust concerns, but they also are complicated by the patent regime
   at play. This Note considers some of the prevailing antitrust theories
   used to analyze such settlements and looks at the three circuit courts
   that have addressed these payments. It concludes that no circuit split
   currently exists and that the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, which
   amended Hatch-Waxman, has curbed the potential for antitrust violations.
   Further, this Note combines theories from the case law and scholarship
   and proposes a test for antitrust liability whereby the burden in the
   antitrust suit is assigned based on the size of the exit payment.
   Finally, this Note applies the proposed test to settlements filed with
   the FTC in the 2006 fiscal year.},

Abstract = {As drug prices continue to rise, many Americans are forced to choose
   between buying food or medicine. In 1984, Congress sought to address
   this issue by enacting the Hatch-Waxman Act. The purpose of the Act was
   to increase the availability of generic drugs by enabling the generic
   companies to challenge the brand companies' patents in litigation. But
   this purpose is frustrated when the brand companies pay the generic
   companies millions of dollars to settle the litigation and delay their
   market entry. These settlements, which are usually referred to as
   ``pay-for-delay{''} or ``reverse payment{''} settlements, benefit the
   pharmaceutical companies at the expense of consumers.
   Reverse payment settlements have been challenged under the antitrust
   laws. In the last decade, the circuit courts have developed three
   approaches to analyzing reverse payment settlements. None of the courts
   considered whether the patent was valid or infringed. Furthermore,
   because courts favor settlement, the prevailing analysis has resulted in
   absolutely no antitrust scrutiny of reverse payment settlements.
   Most recently, the Supreme Court granted a petition for certiorari in
   FTC v. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This Article argues that the Court's
   decision should be guided by the principles in Verizon Communications v.
   Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko. Those principles will lead the Court to
   consider the particular circumstances of the pharmaceutical industry and
   how the Hatch-Waxman Act affects competition in that industry. After
   considering these factors, the Court should conclude that the policy
   favoring settlement should not be considered in this antitrust analysis
   and that the courts should decide the merits of the underlying patent
   claim.},

Abstract = {Event studies of stock price movements have been used to assess the
   anticompetitive impact of `reverse-payment' settlement of patent
   disputes in the drug industry. Evidence for an anticompetitive effect is
   found when financial markets reward a brand manufacturer with larger
   stock market capitalization - signaling the agreed upon generic entry
   date was more profitable (i.e. later) than investors' expectations. In
   practice, reverse-payment cases can involve multiple generic competitors
   and settlements. This paper considers how event-study methodology
   applies in such cases, with a study of the stock price movements of
   Cephalon, manufacturer of the drug Provigil. Cephalon entered into four
   patent litigation settlements with potential generic competitors over a
   two-month period beginning in December 2005. Event study methods can
   readily be applied to such a case. Cephalon's total increase in stock
   value across four narrow windows around each settlement totaled over
   \$1.0 billion, indicating the agreements delayed generic entry beyond
   the market's expectation.},

Abstract = {We study the effect of the degree of exclusivity for the lowest bidder
   on the average price of generic pharmaceuticals in the short and long
   terms. Our results indicate that a 1-percentage-point gain in market
   share of the lowest bidder reduces average costs by 0.2\% in the short
   term and 0.8\% in the long term, but also reduces the number of firms by
   1\%. We find that reducing the number of firms has a strong positive
   (and hence counteracting) effect on average prices, a 1\% reduction
   raising prices by approximately 1\%.},

Abstract = {A recent study examined the effects of both dynamic (between-substance)
   and static (within-substance) competition on prescription drug prices in
   the U.S. It showed that the 1985-2005 increase in between-substance
   competition reduced the average 2017 U.S. price of drugs that were
   already sold in 1997 by 35\%, and that, due to this price reduction,
   36\% of 2017 expenditure on drugs that were first registered during
   1986-2005 was offset by reduced 2017 expenditure on drugs that were sold
   in both 1997 and 2017. This study uses similar methods to examine the
   effect of both between- and within-substance competition on drug prices
   in Denmark. Drug prices are 60\% lower in Denmark than they are in the
   U.S.; per capita drug expenditure is 74\% lower in Denmark than it is in
   the U.S. Our estimates indicate that the 19972017 increase in
   between-substance competition reduced the average 2017 price of ``old
   drugs{''} (drugs already sold in 1997) by 18\%. This price reduction was
   60\% as large as the price reduction due to the increase in
   within-substance competition. We estimate that 24\% of 2017 expenditure
   on drugs that were first registered during 1986-2005 was offset by
   reduced 2017 expenditure on drugs that were sold in both 1997 and 2017.
   The effect of between-substance competition on drug prices should be
   recognized by both health technology assessment decisionmakers and
   antitrust authorities.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Patent law and antitrust law have traditionally been areas of the law
   involving at least some inherent tension. Champions of antitrust argue
   that the patent ``monopoly{''} must be strictly limited as an exception
   to the general legal principle that competition should be unfettered.
   Patent lawyers argue that patents are the result of an exercise of
   congressional authority, enshrined in the Constitution, reflecting the
   policy decision by the Founders that granting a limited exclusionary
   rightwas justified by the public benefits derived from full disclosure
   of the patented invention. In the modern era these competing values have
   played out in the context of so-called ANDA litigation, involving
   disputes between branded pharmaceutical companies and generic
   competitors. Settlement of such litigation has been identified by the
   Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and private parties encouraged by the
   FTC's position, as an antitrust violation, in large part because such
   settlements are viewed as frustrating the congressional purpose in
   promoting early generic competition. After almost a decade of fighting
   these battles in the federal courts, the SupremeCourt addressed the
   issue directly. The result is that such settlements are not per se
   illegal but are also not protected by the presumption of patent validity
   for activities within the ``scope of the patent.{''} Rather, the court
   decided that these agreements should be assessed for antitrust liability
   under the ``rule of reason{''} used in other antitrust contexts.},

Abstract = {Presenting the first comprehensive study of evergreening, this article
   examines the extent to which evergreening behavior-which can be defined
   as artificially extending the protection cliff-may contribute to the
   problem. The author analyses all drugs on the market between 2005 and
   2015, combing through 60,000 data points to examine every instance in
   which a company added a new patent or exclusivity. The results show a
   startling departure from the classic conceptualization of intellectual
   property protection for pharmaceuticals. Rather than creating new
   medicines, pharmaceutical companies are largely recycling and
   repurposing old ones. Specifically, 78\% of the drugs associated with
   new patents were not new drugs, but existing ones, and extending
   protection is particularly pronounced among blockbuster drugs. Once
   companies start down the road of extending protection, they show a
   tendency to return to the well, with the majority adding more than one
   extension and 50\% becoming serial offenders. The problem is growing
   across time.},

Abstract = {Brand and generic drug manufacturers frequently settle patent litigation
   on terms that include a payment to the generic manufacturer. The Federal
   Trade Commission contends that these agreements extend the brand's
   market exclusivity and amount to anticompetitive market division.
   Involved parties defend the settlements as normal business agreements
   that reduce business risk. The anticompetitive hypothesis implies brand
   stock prices should rise with settlement announcements. We classify 68
   brand-generic settlements into those with and without indication of a
   ``reverse payment,{''} and conduct an event study of the settlement
   announcement's influence on the brand's stock price. For settlements
   with indication of a reverse payment, brand stock prices rise on average
   6\% at the announcement. A control group of brandgeneric settlements
   without indication of a reverse payment had no significant effect. Our
   results support the hypothesis that settlements with a reverse payment
   increase the expected profits of the brand manufacturer and are
   anticompetitive.},

Abstract = {State aid for enterprises is applied in the European Union as derogation
   from a rule of creating equal opportunities for starting and running a
   business in the Single European Market. The rules of State
   interventionism in the economy has been defined precisely in this field
   and they tend to seek a compromise between the position of the European
   Commission and the position of the Member State concerned with the
   admissibility of State aid. Economic activity consisting in running a
   community pharmacy is in Poland subject to strict regulation of the Act
   of 6 September 2001 on Pharmaceutical Law. With the aim of increasing
   the standard of pharmaceutical services in 2017 the legislator made
   significant changes in the rules of undertaking the above-mentioned
   activity. Pharmacy activity is most often carried out by enterprises
   classified into the group of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
   The subject of the article is to define a pharmacy as an SMEs group
   enterprises and to analyze available forms of State aid for this group
   of enterprises.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In wealthy nations, non-profit drug R\&D has been proposed to reduce the
   prices of medicines. We sought to review the ethical and economic issues
   concerning non-profit drug R\&D companies, and the possible impact that
   their pricing strategy may have on the innovation efforts from
   for-profit companies targeting the same segment of the pharmaceutical
   market. There are two possible approaches to pricing drugs developed by
   non-profit R\&D programs: pricing that maximises profits and
   ``affordable{''} pricing that reflects the cost of manufacturing and
   distribution, plus a margin that ensures sustainability of the drug
   supply. Overall, the non-profits face ethical challenges - due to the
   lack of resources, they are unable to independently commercialize their
   products on a large scale; however, the antitrust law does not permit
   them to impose prices on potential licensees. Also, reduced prices for
   the innovative products may result in drying the for-profit R\&D in the
   area.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that incumbent firms may acquire innovative targets
   solely to discontinue the target's innovation projects and preempt
   future competition. We call such acquisitions ``killer acquisitions.{''}
   We develop a model illustrating this phenomenon. Using pharmaceutical
   industry data, we show that acquired drug projects are less likely to be
   developed when they overlap with the acquirer's existing product
   portfolio, especially when the acquirer's market power is large because
   of weak competition or distant patent expiration. Conservative estimates
   indicate that 5.3\%-7.4\% of acquisitions in our sample are killer
   acquisitions. These acquisitions disproportionately occur just below
   thresholds for antitrust scrutiny.},

Abstract = {We present evidence that event studies can help antitrust agencies
   forecast impacts of mergers on innovation. In large pharmaceutical
   mergers, cumulative abnormal returns on portfolios of rivals predict
   postmerger changes in the combined firm's research and development
   (R\&D) intensity. More favorable impacts on rivals are associated with
   lower intensities, which is consistent with softening competition.
   Matching merging firms to similar nonmerging firms suggests that we can
   attribute the changes in R\&D intensity to the mergers. We highlight the
   importance of deducting expenses associated with in-process R\&D and
   provide guidance on how to define rivals, construct portfolios, and use
   event studies in merger evaluations.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF BUSINESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},

Pages = {411-429},
Abstract = {In the pharmaceutical industry, a reverse payment (pay-for-delay) is a
   payment from an originator to a generic producer to delay her entry. In
   some recent cases, the US and EU antitrust authorities have banned these
   agreements per se, while in others they have used a rule of reason. This
   paper analyzes their dynamic effects and shows that a ban per se may
   reduce consumer surplus when the generic producer may go bankrupt and
   her financial situation is private information. Reverse payments are
   more beneficial when competition among few players is soft, the economy
   is in a downturn, and the period of drug usage after patent expiry is
   long. Results suggest that a rule of reason is more suited than a ban
   per se.},

Abstract = {Reverse payment patent settlements between brand and generic
   pharmaceutical manufacturers have received substantial scrutiny in
   recent years. While much has been written about the appropriate
   antitrust policy towards these settlements, the literature has paid
   little attention to the effect that changes in that policy might have on
   the incentives of generic manufacturers to develop generic drugs and
   challenge branded patents. We present a basic economic model of generic
   manufacturers investment decisions and argue that these incentives
   should be taken into account in evaluating policy issues. We conclude
   that a per se rule against reverse payment patent settlements could
   chill the incentives for generic investment by increasing the cost and
   uncertainty of patent litigation, and could deprive consumers of
   benefits from lower cost generic drugs.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the following two questions: (i) Is there any
   evidence that firms, like human beings, prefer to partner with alike ?
   (ii) Is there any relationship between the ex ante technological and
   product relatedness of merging parties and the postmerger performances ?
   Using data of patent holdings and product portfolios of big
   pharmaceutical companies, I find that (i) merger deals are more likely
   to be signed between firms with related technologies and drug
   portfolios, and (ii) product relatedness and technology relatedness are
   positively and negatively correlated with postmerger performances,
   respectively. The analysis suggests that the negative effect of
   technology relatedness might be driven by a large human capital
   depreciation following consolidations. The results have important
   implications for competition policy, which are discussed in the
   concluding section.},

Abstract = {Pharmaceutical companies often replace prescription drugs that are
   already on the market with modified versions that have the same active
   pharmaceutical ingredient. On the surface, such activity seems benign
   and perhaps even salutary. Nonetheless, antitrust litigation has
   revealed that firms sometimes modify existing drugs not because new
   formulations would demonstrably improve health outcomes, but principally
   because so-called secondary patents covering the new version of the drug
   enable them to maintain some effective market power over the active
   ingredient for which original, primary patent protection has expired.
   This ``product hopping{''} strategy runs counter to the goal of the
   legislative framework for regulating branded and generic drug approvals,
   which is to create appropriate incentives for discoveries that elevate
   the quality of patient care and human health by providing a period of
   reward for the brand followed by timely and effectual generic entry.
   In this Article, I explain that the rules and institutions involved in
   determining the validity of patents on chemical inventions, certain
   features of drug regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
   Act, and unique market forces in the pharmaceutical sector combine to
   allow strategic product hopping. To address this problem, I propose a
   novel regulatory scheme that would empower the Food and Drug
   Administration ({''}FDA{''}) to induce pharmaceutical companies to
   generate comparative data indicative of therapeutic distinctiveness
   between related forms of small-molecule drugs. I explain that the FDA is
   institutionally well-positioned to serve as an information intermediary
   that can help increase transparency with respect to drug changes, and
   show that the relevant disclosures can be presented in a manner that is
   useful to patients, prescribers, and payers. The proposed framework
   would then enable these market participants to identify and reject
   strategic drug product changes, reducing the manufacturer's incentive to
   pursue such modifications. Ultimately, the FDA's new authority for
   comparative data development could lead to improvements in patient care
   and promote downstream clinical research based on scientific evidence
   gathered under the directives of the proposed scheme.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen a tremendous rise in common ownership, a
   structure in which large institutional investors have significant
   holdings in corporations that are horizontal competitors. Common
   ownership has long been the topic of scholarly debate with many scholars
   traditionally arguing that common ownership presents antitrust problems.
   Rather than enter into the antitrust debate, this Article argues that
   common ownership presents great virtue for corporate governance, and
   more specifically-corporate compliance.
   In recent years the Department of Justice and other enforcement
   authorities have increasingly directed their resources towards enforcing
   laws that are typically oriented towards specific industries, such as
   healthcare (pharmaceuticals), financial and energy industries, or
   geographic areas. These laws-including the Foreign Corruption Practices
   Act, False Claims Act, Bank Secrecy Act, as well as laws and regulations
   aimed at preventing money laundering, environmental, and antitrust
   violations-expose companies associated with specific industries to heavy
   legal risks-which I term ``macro legal risks.{''}
   This Article argues that institutional investors who hold shares in
   corporations in line with the common ownership structure are uniquely
   positioned to enhance the compliance of those corporations with
   industry-oriented laws, and to minimize exposure to macro legal risks.
   Institutional investors who invest in corporations that operate in the
   same industry can take advantage of three interrelated merits of common
   ownership: (1) enhanced incentives for monitoring compliance of
   corporations with industry-oriented laws, which accordingly leads to
   minimizing macro legal risks; (2) privileged access to rulemaking and
   lawmaking; and (3) experimental learning of macro legal risks. These
   merits allow institutional investors to better monitor corporations in
   which they invest and practice effective corporate governance and
   compliance.
   The incentives of institutional investors increase due to increased
   aggregate exposure to problems affecting a certain industry. The
   difficulty of responding to these problems decreases as institutional
   investors are able to apply a one-size-fits-all approach to these
   problems, rather than develop individualized solutions for specific
   corporations. Due to their status as major asset holders, institutional
   investors develop close relationships with regulators and lawmakers,
   giving them a chance to influence regulation beyond the normal notice
   and comment process and anticipate trends in law and regulation.
   Finally, as a result of their wide holdings, institutional investors can
   apply knowledge gained in investigations and enforcement proceedings
   against a corporation to prevent these from happening to other
   corporations within the industry.
   This Article is the first to analyze the benefits of common ownership in
   the area of corporate compliance. It argues that in an era of increasing
   enforcement based on industry-oriented characteristics, institutional
   investors who invest in line with a common ownership structure will
   become more active in overseeing corporate compliance and more effective
   in minimizing corporate wrongdoing.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the evolutionary dynamics of a dual social
   structure encompassing collaboration and conflict among corporate
   actors. We apply and advance structural balance theory to examine the
   formation of balanced and unbalanced dyadic and triadic structures, and
   to explore how these dynamics aggregate to shape the emergence of a
   global network. Our findings are threefold. First, we find that existing
   collaborative or conflictual relationships between two companies
   engender future relationships of the same type, but crowd out
   relationships of the different type. This results in (a) an increased
   likelihood of the formation of balanced (uniplex) relationships that
   combine multiple ties of either collaboration or conflict, and (b) a
   reduced likelihood of the formation of unbalanced (multiplex)
   relationships that combine collaboration and conflict between the same
   two firms. Second, we find that network formation is driven not by a
   pull toward balanced triads, but rather by a pull away from unbalanced
   triads. Third, we find that the observed micro-level dynamics of dyads
   and triads affect the structural segregation of the global network into
   two separate collaborative and conflictual segments of firms. Our
   empirical analyses used data on strategic partnerships and patent
   infringement and antitrust lawsuits in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals
   from 1996 to 2006.},

Abstract = {Background: Assessing drug prices relative to income in the US compared
   to other Organization for Economic CoOperation and Development (OECD)
   countries provides context for policymakers seeking to improve access
   and affordability. Methods: Using current drug p. rice and income data,
   we recreate a historical analysis presented in 1960 to the Senate
   Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly led by Sen. Estes Kefauver. We
   identified frequently prescribed generic and brand name drugs for US and
   international comparison by drug price category (low-price generics,
   mid-price brands, and high-price specialty brands) as a function of
   income. We further extend our analysis to consider US prices relative to
   the current Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Results: For the low-price
   drugs, all fell below 1\% of all of the US income levels presented.
   Mid-price drugs were below 10\% of income for those at the US median
   household income level but approached 30\% of income for those at the
   FPL. High-price drugs varied greatly, reaching over 600\% FPL for one
   product. Conclusions: Americans receive bargain prices on par with
   international comparators for many low-priced generics drugs. For
   commonly used mid-priced drugs or high-priced specialty products,
   whether or not drug prices are considered a bargain in the US compared
   to international markets may depend on individual income. External
   reference pricing policies may help inform the negotiation for some drug
   prices, but affordability may still be limited for lower wage earners.},

Abstract = {This paper connects ideas from recent literature on the economics of
   intellectual property (IP) to address the question: Did the
   strengthening and broadening of IP rights from important patent policy
   changes in the US promote greater innovation? The analysis rests on the
   theory of cumulative innovation, which shows that if IP rights on a
   pioneer invention extend to follow-on research and impediments to
   contracting exist, then strengthening patents can actually reduce
   overall innovation. Recent empirical studies are consistent with the
   theory: patents can significantly deter follow-on research in complex
   technology areas where contracting is difficult (computers, electronics,
   telecommunications) but not in drugs, chemicals and human genes. I
   outline remedies from court decisions and antitrust policy for
   addressing inefficiencies from patent trolling, patent thickets and the
   anti-commons of fragmented ownership. I then apply the analysis to the
   antibiotics market, drawing on recent research, to examine how patent
   and competition policies can be used to improve incentives for drug
   development in the battle against antibiotic resistance. The literature
   provides persuasive evidence that the policy changes overreached in
   broadening and strengthening IP rights and reveals important patent
   reforms for improving the effectiveness of patent systems in the US and
   Canada.},

Abstract = {As a general rule, judges and scholars believe settlement is a good
   thing. But for nearly a century, the Supreme Court has said that patent
   litigation is categorically different, since it offers the chance to
   increase competition by freeing the public from the burdens of a
   monopoly. Based on this theory, and in the hopes of seeing more patent
   litigation fought to completion, the Court has overturned long-standing
   common-law doctrines, declined to enforce otherwise-valid contracts, and
   in the recent case of Federal Trade Commission v Actavis, Inc-subjected
   patent settlements to scrutiny under the antitrust laws. Similar
   reasoning has resulted in legislative initiatives to encourage patent
   challenges, including the regulatory bounty for challenging
   pharmaceutical patents included in the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act and the
   administrative review procedures created by the 2011 America Invents
   Act. Moreover, scholars continue to call for reforms to provoke
   additional patent challenges, again asserting their supposed
   procompetitive benefits.
   This Article is the first to seriously scrutinize the claim that patent
   challenges lead to increased competition. It identifies a number of
   conditions that must hold for a patent challenge to provide this
   particular benefit, and evaluates the reasonableness of assuming that
   the procompetitive benefits of patent challenges are generally
   available. As it turns out, there are a number of ways these conditions
   can and regularly do fail. This Article synthesizes legal doctrine,
   recent empirical scholarship, and several novel case studies to identify
   categories of challenges in which the potential benefits for competition
   are smaller than previously thought or, in some cases, completely
   unavailable.
   This analysis has a number of implications for patent law and policy.
   First, it provides guidance for how the Patent Office should administer
   its new review authority under the America Invents Act. Second, it
   exposes weaknesses in judicially created policies intended to encourage
   more patent challenges. Third, it vindicates the present scope of the
   regulatory bounties provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act and cautions
   against recently proposed expansions of these incentives to other
   technology areas. Fourth, it sheds new light on the competitive
   consequences of patent settlements, and thus informs how the Court's
   recent Actavis decision should be applied in future cases.},

Title = {FIGHTING THE INFECTIONS OF THROAT THROUGH ANTIBIOTICS: A COMPARATIVE
   RESEARCH STUDY WITH NON-JUDICIOUS PRESCRIPTION OF ANTIBIOTICS},

Abstract = {Objective: We aimed to identify the need and significance of necessary
   use of antibiotics that whether they are to be used for the management
   of throat infections or otherwise.
   Method: We conducted this prospective research study at Mayo Hospital
   Lahore in the timeframe of January to November 2018. We cultured and
   identified a total of 362 patients for isolates from almost every age
   group who were diagnosed with ITRs. The researcher used Kirby-Baur
   method for the confirmation of isolates susceptibility to antibiotics in
   the setting of the laboratory. We collected the questionnaires about the
   otorhinolaryngologic antitrust susceptibility about their prescriptions
   of the drugs.
   Results: In the total isolates (362) the frequent presentation was of
   Pneumococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus Aureus with
   respective proportions of 35.34\%, 14.5\% and 23.01\%. The
   otolaryngologists twenty prescribed antibiotics such as Cefotaxime,
   Amoxicillin, Ceftriaxone and Pharyngitis. We reported the susceptibility
   of isolates for Ceftriaxone, Cefotaxime, Penicillin and Amoxiclav with
   respective proportions of 91.0\%, 91.2\%, 71.0\% and 80.4\%. Among the
   less effective antibiotics were Cefixime and Erythromycin with
   respective proportions of 30.7\% and 43.1\%.
   Conclusion: More frequent isolation was reported in Pneumococcal and
   Staphylococci among the patients of throat infection. Both had an
   association with GIT resident flora along with infected respiration
   which required probably harmful pharmacological management.},

Title = {BUYER POWER AND HEALTHCARE PRICES},
Journal = {WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {91},
Number = {1},
Pages = {253-293},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {One major reason why healthcare spending is much higher in America than
   in other countries is that our prices are exceptionally high. This
   Article addresses whether we ought to rely more heavily on buyer power
   to reduce those prices, as other nations do. It focuses on two sectors
   where greater buyer power could easily be exercised: prescription drugs
   covered by Medicare and hospital and physician services covered by
   private insurance.
   The Article concludes that the biggest buyer of all, the federal
   government, should be allowed to negotiate Medicare prescription drug
   prices. This would likely reduce the prices of many branded drugs
   substantially without causing a large reduction in innovation. Multiple
   studies indicate that drug companies have been exceptionally profitable
   in recent years. As a result, they could lower prices on many drugs and
   still earn a competitive return on most research and development.
   Moreover, the incentive to develop important new medicines would remain
   high because the government would have little leverage over the prices
   of these drugs. Finally, if problems with innovation develop, payments
   for new drugs can be increased.
   In contrast, encouraging large insurance companies to merge does not
   appear to be a promising way of lowering healthcare costs. While some
   large mergers may be procompetitive lowering both excessive provider
   prices and insurance premiums most would present significant competitive
   risks. They may allow the merged firm to exert monopsony power over
   small providers, they may create market power and lead to higher
   premiums, or they may permit the merged firm to gain a discriminatory
   advantage over smaller insurance companies, threatening downstream
   competition. Because of these dangers, it would not be wise, as a
   general rule, to permit large health insurers to merge.},

Abstract = {A ``product hop{''} involves the substitution of a new formulation of a
   prescription drug by a pharmaceutical manufacturer for an old version to
   forestall generic competition. In 2015, for example, Forest
   Laboratories, the brand-name drug manufacturer of memantine, an
   Alzheimer's disease treatment, introduced an extended-release version
   and tried to restrict patient access to the previous version. Product
   hops can lead to useful incremental innovation but can also have major
   public health implications by disrupting patients on stable treatment
   regimens and increasing costs for patients and payers. This commentary
   reviews alleged anticompetitive product hopping in the case of
   memantine, which involved proposed conduct that would have left
   Alzheimer's disease patients with no effective choice but to transition
   to memantine XR. Policy solutions that can limit anticompetitive product
   hops include raising the bar for obtaining patents on new drug product
   formulations and changing automatic generic substitution laws. Copyright

   German Statutory Health Insurance funds' perspective. We aim to conduct
   the analysis based on randomized comparative effectiveness studies of
   the relevant treatments for the German setting. For inclusion of
   effectiveness studies, we require results in terms of response rates as
   defined by European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) or American
   College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. We identify conventional triple
   therapy as the relevant comparator. We calculate cost per responder
   based on German direct medical costs. Direct clinical comparisons could
   be identified for both etanercept and infliximab compared to triple
   therapy. For infliximab, cost per responder was 216,392 euros for ACR50
   and 432,784 euros for ACR70 responses. For etanercept, cost per ACR70
   responder was 321,527 euros. Cost was lower for response defined by
   EULAR criteria, but data was only available for infliximab. Cost per
   responder is overestimated by 40 \% due to inclusion of taxes and
   mandatory rebates in German drugs' list prices. Our analysis shows
   specific requirements for cost-effectiveness analysis in Germany. Cost
   per responder for TNF-alpha treatment in the German setting is more than
   double the cost estimated in a similar analysis for the USA, which
   measured against placebo. The difference in results shows the critical
   role of the correct comparator for a specific setting.},

Abstract = {Few marketing problems in society lead to the tragedy of harm that can
   result when firearms are diverted from the legal to the illegal
   marketplace. Product diversion is itself a serious concern for
   marketers, especially marketers of potentially dangerous products, such
   as tobacco, alcohol, firearms, and pharmaceuticals. These products may
   be sought and obtained by consumers who occupy illegal markets or are
   intent on using them for illegal purposes, leading to adverse
   consequences for other consumers, marketers, and society at large.
   Drawing on established marketing principles and accepted methods of
   forensic research, this article reports on a large-scale study of the
   diversion of handguns in the United States and the countermarketing and
   demarketing efforts of firearm marketers to safeguard against its
   occurrence through their distribution systems. The findings suggest that
   (1) significant diversion of handguns to illegal markets occurred in the
   United States during a recent period, (2) industry marketers varied
   widely in their use of safeguards against this diversion but, on
   average, engaged in few countermarketing and demarketing measures, and
   (3) the safeguarding efforts engaged in were found to reduce both
   diversion and its resultant crimes. The study and its findings provide
   an understanding of the nature and effects of firearm diversion and the
   use of countermarketing and demarketing safeguards to reduce its
   occurrence. The study also demonstrates the use of data and data
   collection methodologies from the legal process to inform questions
   about marketing, including controversial aspects of its practice.
   Overall, the research adds to extant thinking on countermarketing and
   demarketing as well as the related areas of social marketing, corporate
   responsibility, and public health.},
