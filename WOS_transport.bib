Abstract = {The paper aims at analysing the role for Antitrust intervention in the
   light of the consolidation trend of the airline industry in Europe. The
   almost full liberalization in the aviation sector (at least for
   intra-community routes) leaded to a situation where, at the same time,
   (i) new players have been entering the market with an increase in
   competition (actual and potential) on EU routes, and (ii) deep forms of
   co-operation (alliances and code sharing) and integration (mergers) have
   been exploited to better perform at national and international level.
   The paper highlights the economic analysis behind Antitrust assessment
   in the evaluation of mergers and cooperation agreements in the air
   transport sector. Consolidated standards for market definition,
   competitive assessment and feasible remedies are presented and discussed
   in the light of the relevant EU case law. Moreover, according to the
   radical changes occurring in the industry - i. e. the emergence of
   peculiar market forces such as low cost carriers and their interaction
   with traditional full service carriers - some preliminary considerations
   are introduced on the likely need for adjusting the assessment criteria
   for an effective Antitrust intervention.},

Abstract = {Due to the negative consequences of cartels for the economy, the
   priority for anti-trust bodies in the European Union has been the fight
   against cartels of enterprises. Current case law practice shows that the
   use of the system of ``negative{''} repressive tools, mainly financial
   penalties, in relation to enterprises that committed cartel practices is
   not sufficiently effective. The need to use positive' tools is
   increasingly emphasized by promoting the building of business management
   strategies based on a culture of compliance with competition rules. This
   role can be played by the antitrust compliance program originating from
   the American practice. The article has a theoretical and cognitive
   character. In the theoretical part, the antitrust compliance scheme and
   tools that are necessary to build a management strategy based on it are
   characterized. In the practical part, the functioning of the antitrust
   program in selected European enterprises is discussed, this part is
   based on the case-study method.},

Abstract = {The paper discusses selected antitrust implications of airline
   alliances. In addition to a categorization of airline alliances and a
   brief discussion of their key competitive effects, our focus is on an
   assessment of efficiencies triggered by various degrees of airline
   cooperation. We find that most types of efficiencies can only be
   considered as partly immunity-specific and should therefore enter an
   assessment of the economic effects of antitrust immunity only with the
   respective incremental benefits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   carrier collaboration can achieve under antitrust immunity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {94},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Airlines maintain complex networks that are to large extents
   complementary. Therefore, some passengers need to change aircraft and
   airlines to fly from their origin to their final destination. The
   present study captures pricing problems in terms of double
   marginalization but goes one step further by incorporating network
   choices. The model involves a two-stage game with two carriers who
   choose their complementary networks in the first stage and fares in the
   second stage. Each carrier's network involves one or two links that are
   distributed geographically or distributed in time. If both carriers
   maintain two links, then transfer passengers can choose between two
   alternative connections which they consider as imperfect substitutes.
   There are only transfer passengers, and maintaining a link is costly.
   The analysis reveals that carrier collaboration and antitrust immunity
   can eliminate double marginalization and create incentives to extend
   networks. Our results indicate that the scope for the improvement of
   carrier networks via antritrust immunity can be rather limited relative
   to the social desirability of more extensive carrier networks. A
   possible policy lesson is that airlines should be granted antitrust
   immunity conditional on network expansion and/or frequency obligations.},

Abstract = {This article shows the actual situation in the air transport
   liberalization process of Germany and the potential way of how it may
   develop into an extensively liberalized airline market. The starting
   point is the liberalization of the European and the north atlantic air
   transport market. These markets show positive results so that further
   liberalization of other markets is desirable. In an extensively
   liberalized airline market the role of the state is limited to set
   parameters for competition to become sustainable without affecting
   safety, social or environmental standards. For this a competition
   concept on the base of the model of contestable markets is proposed as
   well as further liberalization of the fifth and sixth freedom markets.
   Finally, a continuous market observation system seems to be appropriate
   to hinder anticompetitive behaviour. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {THE RELEVANT TEMPORAL MARKET DEFINITION IN ANTITRUST ANALYSIS},
Journal = {BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {68-76},
Abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to compare various theoretical approaches to
   the relevant temporal market definition, collecting the arguments for
   their implementation under the different kinds of antitrust cases. It is
   vital for the markets with peak demand (transport, electricity, markets
   of intergenerational products) or discreet supply (agriculture).
   Methodology. The survey is based on the theoretical and graphical
   modelling of product space perception by consumers. It investigates
   changes of the latter under different marketing strategies of a seller.
   Statistical methods are used to analyse trends of demand and prices for
   iPhones' changes, as well as dynamics of electricity consumption.
   Results. The paper reveals two facing approaches to the definition of
   relevant temporal market: 1) the discrete one that provides a short-run
   analysis of products' substitutability and combines only those time
   periods that are characterized by a stable balance of demand and supply,
   as well as stable market equilibrium; 2) the coherent one that provides
   a long-run analysis of cyclical variation of the market. This cycling is
   based on the awareness of consumers and producers of intertemporal
   substitutability of products. The authors use the model of intertemporal
   competition to explain principles of these approaches and apply it to
   the iPhone market analysis. They conclude that the coherent approach
   must be applied to the temporal market definition for the products with
   elastic demand. Inelastic demand brings the necessity to apply the
   discrete approach to the temporal market definition. These conclusions
   cannot be applied to regulated markets. The system of government
   regulation is the main determinant of the temporal boundaries of such
   markets. Practical implications. The results of this research can be
   used by competition agencies in antitrust cases to define the relevant
   temporal market, where the violations of antitrust legislation can
   occur. The correct definition of the market is the first step of
   structural analysis under antitrust cases that determinates the
   correctness of its next steps and finally - accurate labelling of an
   antitrust violation. Value/originality. The paper grounds capability of
   both (discrete and coherent) approaches to the relevant temporal market
   definition, determines the factors that define what the approach must be
   chosen, as well as the exceptions from the rule.},

Year = {1999},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {This paper argues that recent rail reform in NSW has been successful.
   NSW rail is now not only more cast effective, but also offers improved
   service and safety levels to its customers. As such the NSW rail reforms
   hate been of benefit to the community as a whole, and have laid the
   groundwork for a resugence of the rail sector: Despite the criticism
   surrounding recent job losses, it is argued that the reforms have
   reinvigorated an industry that had been caught up in an ever decreasing
   vicious circle. The success of the 1996 reforms have been dependent upon
   a reform model that mixes factors such as vertical separation and
   independent regulation with government provision of targeted community
   service obligation payments. This paper argues that the most important
   ingredient for rail's future is the removal of the enormous bias in
   government tar and user charging policy against rail and toward; road
   transport. In addition to keeping faith with the traditional National
   Competition Policy agenda, nothing is more important than that
   Australian governments address this continuing and debilitating bias
   against rail transport.},

   unnecessary in the vast majority of cases for efficient competitive
   access to be granted.  If competitive access is to remain an antitrust
   question, then several conditions should be met before intervention

Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {The paper considers in detail strategic changes occurring in the
   organizational context of intermodal transportation and discusses the
   application of economic approaches (primarily transaction -cost
   economics) for assessing the effectiveness of the appropriate governance
   structure in organizing the intermodal transport economic system. The
   paper reviews the developments in intermodal transportation,
   particularly in the context of logistics and supply chain management,
   and recognizes the trend for the formation of one-stop shopping
   megacarriers spurred by deregulation and market requirements. This
   culminates in the need to consider how companies should organize the
   economic governance of the intermodal transport system. The main
   governance structures include market (subcontracting) or hierarchy
   (internal organization). The transaction -cost economics approach is
   reviewed and applied at a conceptual level to provide the core basis
   upon which the assessment of the optimal governance structure in
   intermodal transport can be based. The review of the core economic
   principles indicates that the governance structure in intermodal
   transport is dependent on transaction costs, production costs and
   strategic considerations that a particular structure might entail and
   the policy implications thereof. The potential for empirical research in
   the application of the transaction -cost economics approach to
   intermodal transport is discussed and detailed direction for further
   empirical research is provided as well as discussion of policy
   implications particularly with respect to competition and antitrust.},

Title = {An EU Perspective of `Fair Competition' in Global Air Transport},
Journal = {AIR \& SPACE LAW},

Abstract = {This article discusses the framework of the European Union (Et)
   prohibition on anti-competitive behaviour in the context of benefits and
   risks to actors within its air transport market. The significance of
   third countries endorsing variant regulatory frameworks as the EU begs
   the question of what constitutes fair competition'. The lack of a
   universal meaning of this concept may be an opportunity for the EU to
   lead a discussion in reaching a global approach to fair competition' in
   line with the foundations of its internal framework while also appealing
   to the wider, international, industry. The recent initialling of a
   comprehensive air services agreement between Qatar and the EU provides
   discussion on a proactive way forward for reconciling EU competition
   policy to the approaches among the external air transport market.
   Ultimately, this article considers whether the EU's model of promoting
   competition is fit for a global air transport market and whether or not
   there may be another approach to bring about a cohesive playing field
   not only within Europe but among the international air transport market
   worldwide.},

Abstract = {This paper summarizes and extends the empirical findings of previous
   research by the author, which analyzed the effect of airline cooperation
   on the level of interline fares paid by international passengers. The
   analysis focuses on three measures of cooperation: alliance membership,
   codesharing, and antitrust immunity. The results show that, together,
   these three forms of cooperation lead to a substantial 27 percent
   reduction in interline fares. The paper then computes the aggregate
   benefits from antitrust immunity and codesharing for the Star Alliance's
   interline passengers. The immunity enjoyed by the Star partners
   generated an aggregate benefit of about \$80 million per year for
   interline passengers in 1999. Codesharing among Star partners yielded a
   further annual benefit of around \$20 million. Moreover, if cooperation
   within the Star Alliance had expanded through an extension of antitrust
   immunity to those 1999 partners who did not enjoy it, then \$20 million
   of additional benefits would have been generated. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {Efficiency in the management of electricity transmission networks is
   essential for the success of the liberalized energy markets. The paper
   is dedicated to the short-run management problems of these natural
   monopolies. It analyses how to organize and price access to and use of
   the transport network. After presenting the technical and institutional
   features of the electricity industry, the paper develops the normative
   approach of first-best and second-best pricing by means of nodal prices.
   Then the exercise of market power at some nodes and its consequences for
   the transport system operator are examined. The remaining part is more
   policy oriented, describing and analysing the practical solutions
   implemented in the European Union for energy transport pricing. The
   paper concludes with some remarks about the enforcement of antitrust
   rules in electricity transport.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the last two decades, airline alliances were not only successful in
   extending the size of their networks, but also received approvals by
   public authorities to intensify their cooperation up to merger-like
   revenue-sharing joint ventures (JVs). We empirically investigate the
   impact of the implementation of such joint ventures on both the
   respective airlines' network structure and their productive efficiency.
   Using U.S. DOT T100 International Segment data and applying airline
   market fixed effects models, we find that joint ventures compared to
   services with a lower degree of cooperation lead to a 3-5 percent
   increase in seat capacity between the respective partner airlines' hub
   airports; however, this is done at the expense of services elsewhere in
   the network. Productive efficiency, as measured by load factors, is
   found to be 0.5-5 percent lower for joint venture routes compared to
   routes operated under antitrust immunity only. We use our empirical

Abstract = {In this paper, I examine the role of oligopolistic competition in
   international trade when countries have different technologies. I look
   at a Situation in which countries have the same demand structure with
   constant elasticity, markets are segmented between countries, and
   transport costs are required for trade. In oligopoly, each county can
   have the critical level of competition. With those critical levels, I
   show when two-way trade is promoted or vanishes in the cases of small or
   large technology gaps. I also investigate a possibility that antitrust
   policy can backfire in an open economy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Policy makers encourage airline-high speed rail (HSR) cooperation to
   promote intermodal passenger transport. We study the strategic formation
   of airline-HSR partnerships (depending on sunk costs and firms'
   bargaining power) and their effects on consumer surplus and social
   welfare. We assume that airline-HSR agreements serve to offer a bundle
   of domestic HSR and international air services. In a capacity purchase
   (CP) agreement, the airline buys train seats to sell the bundle, whereas
   in a joint venture (JV) agreement firms create a distinct business unit.
   We find that both agreements increase traffic in the network, and
   thereby may not reduce congestion at hub airports. We provide antitrust
   authorities with a simple two-tier test for the CP agreement to improve
   consumer surplus. Contrary to airline-HSR mergers, the JV agreement
   benefits consumers independent of hub congestion and mode substitution.
   Simulation results show that, in case of cooperation, public agencies
   should prefer firms to create a JV, unless the related sunk costs are
   far greater than the costs of the CP agreement. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This paper develops heuristic approaches to define the market and
   measure concentration in the inland transhipment market where different
   terminal operators compete. These approaches can be used by policymakers
   to implement more effective policies that could lead to an increase in
   the market share of intermodal freight transport (IFT). The first
   approach segments the market using a transport cost analysis. The second
   approach uses the total trade and the aggregate throughput of the
   terminals in each IFT demand area. The similarity in results validates
   the two approaches, suggesting that they can both be used in situations
   of limited data availability. Applying these approaches to the IFT
   network of the European Union, we find that inland transhipment markets
   in the EU are oligopolistic in structure and thus highly concentrated.
   In general, the north of the EU shows less concentration compared with
   the central and southern regions of Europe. According to the second
   approach, transhipment markets have a slightly higher degree of
   concentration compared with the first approach. Such concentration needs
   more attention from policymakers so as to develop policies to increase
   competition and to make economic policies more effective.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to empirically identify the competitiveness of container
   ports in Asia by examining factors influencing the perceived competitive
   edge of each port using the Hierarchical Fuzzy Process, a method
   embracing human knowledge and/or judgement into a mathematical
   framework. This analysis is unique in that the `human-perceived'
   competitiveness on Asian container ports is examined under the
   quantifiable framework. The findings reveal that Singapore is the most
   competitive port among the sampled ports. Moreover, the methodology
   employed here shows the potential to be applicable to other transport
   and logistics related service industries.},

Title = {A Comprehensive Study of Air Transport Liberalization Through the Lens
   of Strategic Airline Alliances},
Journal = {AIR \& SPACE LAW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4-5},
Pages = {347-391},
Abstract = {The present study examines the issue of the liberalization of air
   transport through the lens of strategic airline alliances. Alliances are
   seen as a corollary to the suboptimal regulatory framework governing
   international civil aviation, stemming from `the nationality rule'. The
   `nationality rule' provides that majority ownership and effective
   control of an airline must be vested in the country that designates it.
   This requirement has nurtured the establishment of national airlines and
   has prevented the industry from consolidating out of fear that traffic
   rights, negotiated bilaterally between States, will be lost. What is
   more, it has locked States into a `prisoner's dilemma', stalling
   liberalization. Airlines have reacted by forging alliances to emulate
   mergers and reap merger-like efficiencies. The present study examines
   the way that the airline industry has positioned itself strategically
   within the suboptimal regulatory framework in order to unleash the
   benefits of liberalization. It finds that the model of open skies, metal
   neutrality and antitrust immunity, pioneered by KLM and Northwest in
   1992, has embedded a degree of de facto liberalization. Twenty-five
   years after its introduction, this model seems to have exhausted its
   liberalizing potential, threatening to lock States into yet another
   prisoner's dilemma. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
   is presently preparing a broad programme to deal with a wide variety of
   aspects of air transport liberalization, including airline alliances.
   The present study aims to contribute to the ICAO's research effort and,
   more broadly, to the long list of works on air transport liberalization.},

Abstract = {Following the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union and the
   transition period that followed, the UK and EU have embarked upon a
   journey to form a new relationship. With the entry into force of the
   EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) in May 2021, now is an
   opportune moment to consider what has been achieved and what is yet to
   come in the areas of competition (antitrust rules and merger control)
   and State aid. This article examines the current state of play in these
   important areas for ongoing and future international cross-border
   activity, in which international airlines play a central role. It
   identIes and reflects on the key `moving parts' in this unchartered
   EU-UK regulatory environment: law reform, the competition authority's
   role and future regulatory cooperation.},

Abstract = {The major aims of certification of any GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite
   System) would be to establish minimum guarantees of quality (as
   expressed in such dimensions as accessibility, availability, continuity,
   integrity, reliability and accuracy). Furthermore, technological
   advances in the areas of CNS/ATM (Communications-Navigation-
   Surveillance/ Air Traffic Management) and decision support must be
   leveraged to evolve a modernized Airspace System. An ``Open Sky
   policy{''}, at least as formulated by the US government, has its limits.
   The next step must be an ``Open Skies multilateral agreement{''}, also
   called an ``Open Aviation Area{''}, which may shape Transatlantic
   traffic. Within such ``Open Aviation Area{''}, which is marked by the
   absence of restrictions upon the operation of air services operated
   within the area, competition must be regulated. Air transport is the
   only sector which is not regulated under the General Agreement on Trade
   in Services (GATS) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of
   the World Trade Organization (WTO)(1).
   The establishment of a Transatlantic Common Aviation Area (TCAA) needs
   to follow common approaches on a range of regulatory issues: a major
   issue will be the application of EU competition rules and US antitrust
   laws. This paper discusses the obstacles which the air transport
   industry faces when it will move from the current restrictive framework
   to a free regime, as shaped by the WTO/GATS, and provides a broad view
   on the Transatlantic Common Aviation Area (TCAA) initiatives in air
   navigation, highlighting legal lessons learned in the frame of the
   ``modernization of the European Airspace{''}(2).},

Title = {High-speed rail and air transport competition and cooperation: A
   vertical differentiation approach},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL},

Volume = {94},
Pages = {456-481},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper considers vertical differentiation between air transport and
   high-speed rail (HSR) with different ranges of travel distance to
   analyze the air-HSR competition effects on fares, traffic volumes and
   welfare, as well as the conditions under which air-HSR cooperation is
   welfare-enhancing. The analysis is conducted in a hub-and-spoke network
   with a network carrier, an HSR operator, and a spoke airline, taking
   into account potential hub airport capacity constraint. We find that
   air-HSR competition in the connecting market may result in the network
   airline charging an excessively high price in the HSR-inaccessible
   market. This effect is present even when the HSR-inaccessible route is a
   duopoly-airline market. On the other hand, air-HSR cooperation increases
   fares in the connecting market, and an improvement in rail speed or
   air-HSR connecting time reduces airfare on the routes where HSR and the
   airline compete. When the airline cannot serve all the markets due to
   limited hub airport capacity, it would withdraw from the market in which
   it has less competitive advantage over HSR. Finally, air-HSR cooperation
   is more likely to be welfare improving when the hub airport is capacity
   constrained, and when either air transport or HSR exhibits, strong
   economies of traffic density. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between multimarket contact (MMC)
   and competitive supply decisions by firms. Using US air-carrier traffic
   data, we find that a carrier's MMC is negatively associated with the
   available seats in a market. This finding provides support for the
   ``mutual forbearance hypothesis{''} and suggests that MMC facilitates
   tacit collusion in the supply of capacity. We also find that tacit
   collusion may be more difficult to achieve on longer-distance routes,
   where carriers face difficulties monitoring the capacities of rivals
   that compete through indirect routings. On the longer-distance routes,
   the negative relationship between MMC and capacity thus diminishes.
   Finally, we show that the negative impact of MMC on capacity has
   increased in strength over the past 10 years. Since the impact of MMC on
   reducing capacity may lead to higher airfares, our findings contribute
   to important antitrust considerations.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to test the ex-post cost structure
   effects in horizontal mergers and acquisitions (M\&A). Our proposed
   methodology quantifies cost structure effects empirically to inform
   competition policy around M\&As in the airline industry. The results
   show that horizontal M\&As involving unprofitable firms significantly
   reduce variable costs and increase fixed costs ex-post. M\&As involving
   only profitable firms show no significant impact on the cost structure.
   We offer support that the ex-post cost structure effects of airline
   M\&As depend on the incentives to improve efficiency, reflected in the
   ex-ante performance of the merging firms. We further argue that market
   behavior may not just depend on market structure but cost structures
   too, all of which should be accounted for in antitrust decision making
   and regulation around airline M\&As.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to maritime literature by constructing a
   theoretical model to empirically examine the determinants of
   profitability for container carriers. The findings show that theoretical
   derivations along are not sufficient to completely identify the impacts
   of changes in variables on the profitability of carriers. By contrast,
   empirical results of this study show that the impacts on the carriers'
   profits are significantly positive with respect to regional economic
   growth, individual fleet expansion and technological progress, but
   significantly negative with respect to the expansion of regional fleet
   capacity and soaring fuel prices. Unexpectedly, growing vessel size
   brings an insignificant negative effect to the profitability of
   carriers. According to the implications derived from the theoretical
   model and empirical study, this study also suggests that
   quantity-oriented rather than price oriented strategies will be more
   effective to improve the profitability of carriers. Emphasizing the
   effect of shipping alliances on market reactions to freight rate changes
   and on the improved chances to realize scale economies of larger ships,
   this paper also provides justification of government regulatory policies
   granting limited antitrust immunity for container shipping lines.},

Abstract = {According to European merger control regulation, a merger which leads to
   substantial impediments to competition might be prohibited, or
   competition authorities might apply remedies to prevent market
   dominance. Most transnational airline mergers in Europe became subject
   to such remedies. In particular, merging airlines are obliged to
   surrender slots at congested airports to new entrants or expanding
   competitors. In this paper, first the potential competitive effects of
   airline mergers on city-pair markets are discussed. Second, the remedies
   imposed by the European Commission are analyzed from a theoretical
   perspective. The empirical assessment of developments on city-pair
   markets subject to remedies shows the limited success of the measures
   taken by the European Commission. Finally, the paper discusses options
   for future merger control in the European air transport industry.},

Abstract = {This paper, based on a published report by the International Transport
   Forum at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
   (ITF), examines the issues, or leadwinds', preventing aviation from
   becoming a truly market-based sector. It paints a brief portrait of the
   history of regulation and deregulation in aviation and the role of
   competition policy in a liberalised aviation marketplace. It then
   focuses on the level playing field, which is often used to argue for
   protectionist policies and ownership restrictions on air carriers. The
   paper suggests that some of the controls on market access in place today
   may do more harm to consumers and the broader economy than good.},

Journal = {TRANSPORT POLICY},

Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The literature has always looked at co-operation in the shipping
   industry with some benevolence. While co-operation benefits the
   transport industry as it reduces operators, guarantees higher profits
   and regulates supply, does it also increase the consumers' surplus, or
   does it cause lower benefits and eventually inefficiency'? In fact,
   liner shipping is the sole industry that is heavily exempted from
   antitrust regulations, both in Europe and North America. The paper,
   moving from the recent decision of the EU regarding the maritime liner
   sector, and from the EU Commission's Consultation Paper on the review of
   Regulation 4056/86, aims at investigating in what ways antitrust rules
   can ``monitor and control{''} the market in a proper way according to
   the emerging trends of integration in the maritime logistics sector. (C)

Title = {The empirical analysis of the impact of alliances on airline operations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2005},

Abstract = {Airline alliances dominate the air transport industry with the largest
   carriers belonging to one of the four alliance groupings-Wings,(1) Star
   Alliance, oneworld, SkyTeam-which represent 56\% of world revenue
   passenger kilometers. Although much research has been carried out to
   evaluate the impact of alliance membership on performance of airlines,
   little has been done on the perceived impacts by participating airlines.
   This paper gathers opinions of all the airlines, belonging to the four
   global alliances in 2002 on the impact alliances have had on their
   traffic and on their performance in general. To achieve this, a
   comprehensive survey of the alliance management departments of airlines
   participating in the alliances was carried out. The survey examined
   which type of cooperation among carriers (frequent flyer programmes,
   code share, strategic alliance without antitrust immunity, strategic
   alliance with antitrust immunity) have produced the most positive impact
   on traffic and which types of route (short haul, long haul, hub-hub,
   hub-non-hub, non-hub-non-hub) have been affected the most. In addition,
   the respondent airlines quantified the effect alliances have had on
   specific areas of their operation, such as load factors, traffic, costs,
   revenue and fares. Their responses are analysed by alliance groupings,
   under airline and under geographic region to establish which group, type
   of carrier and geographic region has benefited the most. The results
   show that each of the four global alliances groupings has experienced
   different results according to the type of collaboration agreed amongst
   their member airlines. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine the effects of the gradual process
   of liberalization of the Community air transport market. The european
   airlines networks have mainly a `'hub and spoke'' structure inherited
   from geography and previous regulation. It is argued that nose-to-nose
   competition between the major Community flag carriers is rather
   unlikely. Two network effects are analysed. The first one is a
   `'supply-side'' network effect arising from cost complementarities. The
   second network effect is a `'demand-side'' one. Due to their preferences
   on time schedule, frequency and quality of the service, travellers face
   some arbitrage for the choice of the carrier and of the type of routing
   in some intra-european markets. These two network effects are used to
   analyse the consequences of a merger and of a cooperative agreement
   between two airlines.},

Abstract = {When firms meet in more than one market, it is generally regarded that
   the possibility of collusion will increase because of mutual
   interdependence (or mutual forbearance). Mutual forbearance is tacit
   collusion that directly results from familiarity and deterrence. This
   paper examines the effect of multimarket contact on airline prices in
   the Chinese domestic airline market where private and low-cost carriers
   have been thriving and high-speed rail services growing quickly in the
   last few years. We find strong evidence supporting the mutual
   forbearance hypothesis in high revenue markets. We also find that the
   collusive effect due to increasing multimarket contact is insignificant
   within the same airline group, whereas multimarket contact between
   airlines in different airline groups triggers higher airfares.},

Title = {Using Online Data to Explore Competitive Airline Pricing Policies Case
   Study Approach},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2010},
Number = {2184},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {Since the mid-2000s, the airline industry has seen volatile fuel prices,
   a record number of carriers ending service, and a merger between two
   major airlines. In a time of such turmoil in the industry, it is
   increasingly important to understand the relationship between airline
   consolidation and competitive pricing policies, because this
   relationship directly affects the formation of new airline policies
   associated with competition policy (antitrust), deregulation, and
   mergers. However, there is a lack of consensus about market
   concentration and its influence on airfares, mainly because of data
   limitations of past research. Given the emergence of online booking
   engines, there is a new opportunity to collect detailed fare data. This
   project uses disaggregate online airfare data to study the relationship
   between market concentration and pricing policies. The data set includes
   62 markets that cover a broad range of market structures. A case study
   approach is used to analyze the data. Using disaggregate fare data, this
   study finds low price dispersion can be associated with both low and
   high levels of market concentration. As the day of departure approaches,
   price dispersion is observed to increase or decrease, depending on the
   market. Additionally, peak and off-peak periods demonstrate different
   pricing strategies. Markets with codeshares sometimes exhibit unusually
   high price dispersion.},

   NSW Bus reform process of the relationship between central agencies,
   service providers, the academic community, key consultants and
   contractors within the setting of the transport service organisation
   framework. Sydney is a modern city with heavy rail, light-rail, monorail
   and an extensive Harbour, with bus services owned by Government as well

Abstract = {This paper develops a model of price competition between two
   international airline alliances, with consumers' preferences vertically
   differentiated by the number of stops. Alliances benefit the interline
   passengers. Alliances with antitrust immunity do not benefit interline
   passengers more than those without antitrust immunity, in contrast to
   the Cournot-type settings. While antitrust immunity leads to higher
   fares for non-stop travel between hubs of alliance partners, granting it
   might be necessary to induce consolidation between carriers. Formation
   of alliances with antitrust immunity is consistent with the proposed
   model, even though these are likely to decrease individual carriers'
   profit.},

Abstract = {The late 1980s witnessed a wave of cross-national domestic airline
   mergers that met with consistent antitrust policy approval. This paper
   explains the antitrust-review success of domestic airline mergers by
   focusing on international competitive effects. These promote the
   concurrence of private and public interest political forces behind
   lenient antitrust reviews, thus furthering political support for
   antitrust approval. The analysis extends Farrell and Shapiro's (1990)
   framework for analysing the national welfare merit of mergers, in order
   to encompass international competitive effects. A dual method
   (quantitative and qualitative) empirical strategy yields supporting
   evidence for the political economic hypothesis.},

Title = {Do classes of gas stations contribute differently to fuel prices?
   Evidence to foster effective competition in Spain},
Journal = {ENERGY POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {139},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Despite the relatively large number of gas stations reached in Spain
   after decades of sectorial reforms, pre-tax fuel prices in the country
   remain systematically among the highest in the EU. The literature
   provides evidence suggesting that a low intensity of competition in the
   retail distribution could contribute to these casual observations. With
   the purpose of shedding light on ways to design effective competition
   measures, we conduct an empirical analysis of more than ten million
   observations containing information about prices, brands, and locations
   at the station level. This allows us to know whether the exit (entry) of
   some classes of stations have the ability to reduce the prices of nearby
   competitors. Our results suggest that the presence in a local market of
   a station belonging to the network of the dominant market companies will
   tend to generate prices above the average. This is not only because
   these stations set higher prices but also because their presence will
   give rise to overpricing by local competitors. The opposite occurs with
   the self-advertised as ``low-cost{''} stations. Policy measures
   promoting the gradual exit of stations associated with the dominant
   companies seem quite reasonable in view of the commitment to the
   transition toward transport decarbonization.},

Title = {The assessment of market power of hub airports},
Journal = {TRANSPORT POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {29},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {29-37},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Airport regulation regimes are under revision in many countries. The
   decision about the extent of airport regulation is based on an economic
   analysis of market power, which is done in two steps. The first step
   involves defining the relevant markets the airport is operating on. This
   in turn is based on an economic analysis of the particular circumstances
   of the airport, and must be compatible with competition law. The second
   step consists of the evaluation of the airport's competitive position in
   all identified markets. Due to industry particularities, many diverse
   issues must be taken into account in this process, such as questions of
   upstream and downstream market interaction, airport congestion,
   peak-load pricing, or offsetting bargaining power. Many of these
   questions have been theoretically analyzed in the industrial
   organization literature, but have only rarely been applied in practical
   competition analysis with respect to airports. This paper builds a
   bridge between the theoretical insights and their practical application
   to airport regulation policy. We derive the principles for a sound
   economic analysis of the market power of airports, given the time and
   data constraints encountered in practice by the regulatory authorities
   and other involved parties, and propose a general framework for the
   analysis of market power of airports. We focus on hub airports, as the
   analysis of these gateways covers all the relevant issues, including
   countervailing power of the hub operator. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Farmers' selling opportunities are often limited because of few

   develops an empirical model to analyze the potential for exercise of
   monopsony power in these food markets. The approach is based on
   estimation of residual supply functions facing a processor or group of
   processors. Residual supply is the raw product supply facing a processor
   or group of processors after rivals' demands for the product have been
   accounted for. The model is applied to the processing tomato industry in
   California. Estimation results suggest that the oligopsony potential in
   this market is limited.},

Abstract = {This paper compares the decisions of the European Commission on airline
   merger cases. The authors provide an overview of the merger decisions
   between 1996 and 2009 and analyze the definitions of the relevant market
   applied in each case. First, it considers the relevant market definition
   develop from the origin and destination approach, and second, the role
   of economics in the European Commission's airline merger decisions. The
   paper shows that the Commission has broadened the market definition by
   demand and supply substitutes only in the case of leisure traffic.
   Quantitative methods have not been used extensively which reflects a
   skeptical attitude towards economics based approaches in merger policy.

Abstract = {Since the late 1980s the EU has made great strides in the liberalization
   of network markets. This article assumes a horizontal perspective,
   juxtaposing different network markets while focusing solely on the rules
   and policies at EU level. A six step checklist is applied to facilitate
   a comparative analysis of EU regulatory liberalization in gas,
   electricity, telecoms, postal services, and rail and air transport.
   Competition policy is discussed with respect to: the relation between
   regulation and competition policy; the role of the EC Curt; the
   `essential facility' doctrine; defining relevant markets; and merger
   control in network industries. Finally, the question is addressed as to
   whether these network industries operate in an EC internal market. The
   answer is no. Policy recommendations: the EU defines a well-considered
   overall strategy for network market liberalization; the issue of the
   internal market with common regulators, at least where a subsidiarity
   test is passed, should be squarely addressed.},

Title = {Rail freight efficiency and competitiveness in Australia},
Journal = {TRANSPORT REVIEWS},

Volume = {18},

Pages = {241-256},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Note = {Australasian Transport Research Forum, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND, 1996},
Abstract = {In 1994/95, the Australian rail freight task was approximately 100
   billion tonne kilometres (btkm). This freight task included some 37 btkm
   for the haulage of iron ore in Western Australia, 28 btkm for coal
   haulage in Queensland and New South Wales and about 16 btkm for
   interstate rail freight. This paper mainly concerns how improvements can
   be made to the efficiency and competitiveness of interstate rail freight
   services through the upgrading of sections of mainline track that
   currently have severe speed - weight restrictions. Recent improvements
   in rail freight efficiency are discussed, with emphasis on two
   indicators: average unit revenues (cents per net tonne km), and average
   energy efficiency (net tonne km per MJ). Rail freight efficiency is high
   for the Western Australia iron-ore operations, Queensland coal
   operations and Adelaide-Perth general freight operations. However,
   between Australia's three largest cities of Melbourne, Sydney and
   Brisbane, some 36\% of the mainline track fails to meet basic fast
   freight train standards with a ruling grade of 1 in 66 and no curve
   radius less than 800 m. The contraints on efficient rail freight
   operations imposed by severe terrain, and how the effects of terrain may
   be reduced by improved track alignment, are discussed. Some economically
   warranted rail track investment measures are outlined, including those
   identified for a National Transport Planning Taskforce. These measures
   have the potential to reduce liquid fuel use by over 250 million litres
   a year. Factors affecting competitive neutrality between road and rail
   freight that are outside of the present scope of Australia's National
   Competition Policy are broadly considered. These factors include the
   extensive upgrading of the National Highway System with full Federal
   funding, and low levels of road cost recovery from heavy trucks
   operating over long distances.},

Abstract = {The stability of collusion is compared assuming quadratic transport
   costs under two spatial pricing schemes, uniform mill pricing and
   spatial price discrimination. This comparison uniquely allows fully
   endogenous location choice and examines when two firms collude, when two
   of three firms collude and when three firms collude. Spatial price
   discrimination facilitates collusion more than uniform pricing in the
   first two of the three examinations but not in the third. This
   heterogeneity argues that the presence of price discrimination by itself
   does not inform antitrust authorities about the likelihood of collusion.},

Abstract = {Airlines frequently use code-share agreements allowing each other to
   market seats on flights operated by partner airlines. Regulation may
   allow code-share agreements with antitrust immunity (cooperative price
   setting), or without antitrust immunity, or not at all. I compare the
   relative welfare effects of these regulation regimes on complementary
   airline networks. A crucial point is that such agreements are used to
   identify and price-discriminate interline passengers. I find that
   interline passengers always benefit from code-share agreements while
   non-interline passengers are worse off. Furthermore, I show that the
   latter effect questions the overall usefulness of code-share agreements

Abstract = {The use of air-rail intermodal agreements has expanded over recent
   decades. Significant benefits have been associated with such agreements
   for airlines, rail operators, intermodal airports and consumers. In
   addition, a number of environmental benefits are perceived to be
   associated with a modal shift from air to rail. However, these
   agreements could, in some circumstances, raise competition concerns and,
   unlike cooperation agreements between airlines, there has been a limited
   focus by competition authorities to date on examining their competitive
   effects. Uncertainty as to regulatory treatment maybe limiting the
   spread and scope of air-rail intermodal agreements. This paper considers
   the factors relevant to any competition assessment of these agreements
   and raises the question of whether environmental benefits should be
   considered as part of the assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {One price for all? Price discrimination and market captivity: Evidence
   from the Italian city-pair markets},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {75},
Pages = {231-244},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper tests whether, and to what extent, airlines exploit market
   captivity by using price discrimination strategies. The Italian
   passenger market is particularly fit for this purpose, given the high
   differentials in the degree of the inter-modal competition amongst
   domestic connections. Results show that, ceteris paribus, airlines adopt
   a different pricing behaviour depending on the degree of inter-modal
   market captivity. First, in highly concentrated markets with respect to
   air competitors, airlines price higher when the intermodal competition
   is limited. This proves that inter-modal market captivity strengthens
   the effect of market power. Second, the inter-temporal price
   discrimination leads to a J-shaped distribution of fares over time,
   which is more pronounced when the inter-modal competition is effective.
   This suggests that airlines need to adopt a pricing technique that
   allows for a greater market segmentation in order to compete
   successfully with high-speed rail transport and to extract a larger part
   of passengers' surplus. These results are relevant in terms of
   transport-investment implications and competition policy. The indirect
   benefits that investments in rail infrastructure would yield through
   downward pressures on competing airline fares should be embedded in any
   cost-benefit analysis of high-speed networks investments and in any
   policy evaluation of measures that aim to reduce the territorial gaps in
   infrastructure endowment and accessibility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {We characterize mixed-strategy equilibria when capacity-constrained
   suppliers can charge location-based prices to different customers. We
   establish an equilibrium with prices that weakly increase in the costs
   of supplying a customer. Despite prices above costs and excess
   capacities, each supplier exclusively serves its home market in
   equilibrium. Competition yields volatile market shares and an
   inefficient allocation of customers to firms. Even ex-post
   cross-supplies may restore efficiency only partly. We show that
   consumers may benefit from price discrimination whereas the firms make
   the same profits as with uniform pricing. We use our findings to discuss
   recent competition policy cases and provide hints for a more refined
   coordinated-effects analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {This paper considers a location model to illustrate the effect of zoning
   on competition. A planner is in charge of designing a city in a circular
   space where firms and consumers are located on different sides. With
   this type of market configuration, equilibrium in location under concave
   transport costs is proved. Then, a welfare function with different
   weights attached to consumer and firm surpluses is introduced to
   highlight zoning regulation as an influential competition policy tool.
   Depending on the regulator's political profiles and the demand, it is
   shown that zoning can lead to strong, weak, or moderate competition.},

Abstract = {As two of the fastest-growing economies, China and India share many
   similarities. However, the air transport sector of the two countries
   exhibits substantial differences 30 years after deregulation. Private
   and low-cost airlines have become dominant players in the Indian airline
   market while the state-owned airlines still enjoy a dominant status in
   the Chinese market. The econometric analysis of this research suggests
   that the presence of a low-cost carrier (LCC) on a route has the effect
   of reducing the airfare and stimulating the demand for air travel in
   India, no matter the LCC presence is measured by market shares or
   dummies. Chinese LCCs have similar competitive effects only when the LCC
   entry is measured by dummy variables. Airport concentration in India
   could lead to cost savings and thus lower airfares, but this did not
   occur in China due largely to the lack of a culture of antitrust
   compliance. In both countries, airport concentration is positively
   associated with traffic demand. In India this may imply an increase in
   consumer welfare as airport concentration increases while in China this
   could mean that consumers would not be able to explore their welfare
   benefits to the full potential since concentration is positively
   associated with airfares. We also find that the absolute value of the
   price elasticity of the Indian market is much larger than that in the
   Chinese market, probably due to the high LCC penetration rates in India.},

Pages = {98-104},
Abstract = {U.S. antitrust authorities have increasingly forced merging companies to
   divest assets as a condition for merger approval, with the goal of
   creating a more competitive postmerger environment. This study examined
   the effectiveness of this government strategy in the context of the
   airline industry, in which forced divestitures have occurred in recent
   consolidations. The study used unique data on assets critical to airport
   facilities that were involved in the divestitures to document the
   reallocation of those assets to low-cost carriers. Estimates of the
   impact of the divestitures on airfares were then calculated. The results
   show that, at the affected airports, fares for merging carriers fell by
   3\% and fares for nonmerging carriers fell by 1\% relative to airports
   at which no divestiture occurred. These results provide evidence that
   the divestiture strategy used by antitrust authorities is effective in
   this setting in mitigating market power.},

Abstract = {The existence of exclusive rights to produce or supply services means a
   monopoly. Often it is called a natural monopoly. Exclusive rights are
   granted for a long period of time, which should encourage major
   investments in infrastructure, the development of which is unlikely to
   occur without a guaranteed market. But sometimes exclusive rights are
   used in situations where there is no natural monopoly. Exclusive rights
   are, in many respects, one of the main routes to market. Exclusive
   rights may allow monopoly pricing and other market power tools.
   Regulatory measures used by competition authorities alone do not make it
   possible to avoid such a situation, as they often show a very low
   success rate in preventing market power from being used to protect
   consumers. The purpose of this article is to analyze the theory and
   practice of preparing negotiating strategies in a complex way, to reveal
   opportunities to develop and implement these negotiating strategies,
   taking into account competition policy actions. The subject of the study
   is the preparation of negotiation strategies taking into account
   competition policy actions in the market. The research problem of the
   article - there is not enough tools in the negotiation theory to help
   develop negotiation strategies in line with competition policy actions.},

Abstract = {As issued in the Competition Policy Brief on the new state aid rules for
   a competitive aviation industry by the Competition Directorate-General
   of the European Commission in February 2014(1), it will be more
   difficult for unprofitable airports, to obtain financial public
   subsidies on EU, national or regional level. Although the positive
   impact of small airports on the regional development and general
   accessibility was mentioned, still the operating aid to the airports
   shall be cut out over a maximum of 10 years. It has been further stated
   that the vast majority of small and regional airports experience
   problems to cover their running operative costs, as a result from an
   intensive market competition and overlapping of airports' catchment
   areas preventing even some promising airports from growth. Public
   subsidies are mostly used by the airport management for infrastructural
   investments, to cover operating losses or to attract price-sensitive
   airlines. Herewith, among other things, the EU Commission is pointing
   out at the lack of cooperation structures and network strategies among
   the regional airports and at rather isolated and individual approach
   during elaboration of the airport development scenarios. However, the
   Competition Policy Brief permits public aid to regional airports, among
   other things if there is sufficient transports need to establish
   transition periods for small airports; the need for more flexibility of
   the regional airports in the remote areas has been underlined. The EU
   Commission is expecting herewith not to close the regional airports, but
   to stimulate them to operate on cost efficient and profitable basis, and
   that only the most inefficient airports will be closed.
   To cope with the upcoming challenges the regional airports are demanded
   now to revaluate and reconsider their future development plans. While
   focusing on the passenger traffic many regional airports ignore or
   underestimate the benefits of the airfreight market. Although the air
   cargo has rather a low volume, but very high revenue yield part.
   Business internationalization is one of the important driving forces for
   the airfreight nowadays as well as decreasing air transport costs due to
   improving efficiency and growing competition among the air carriers.
   Most regional airports in the Baltic Sea region that act totally
   isolated, do not have a clear picture of the current situation on the
   international air cargo market, its future perspectives and sustainable
   development plans. Trying to meet the market demand, the regional
   airports are making huge and unjustified investments, e.g. improving
   airport infrastructure. It is not clear till now which elements of the
   Pan-Baltic cargo market could be managed as an alternative revenue
   yielding services for consolidated operation by air or what
   infrastructure is needed to provide the opportunity for an optimal
   economic mix of road-rail-air-sea transport? Nowadays, to a large degree
   air cargo traffic relies on scheduled, frequent passenger services in
   hub-and-spoke as well as in point-to-point traffic. Regional airports
   are presently suffering from a lack of scheduled uplift capacity. The
   volume currently transported by air in the regional airports is almost
   entirely based on the occasional charter flights. However, the growth of
   the air cargo business is likely to be based not only on cargo charters,
   but to a larger extend on truck-based services for transit shipments.
   Onward transportation by truck may occur on road feeder service, so
   called ``flying trucks{''}, where a real truck substitutes a flight.
   ``Flying trucks{''} are having flight numbers etc., therefore they must
   be prioritized in many ways in the BSR transport policy.
   This paper investigates the role of Road Feeder Services concept
   (thereafter named here as ``Flying Truck{''}) as an optional freight
   value proposition for the development of the regional airports and their
   possible participation in the air cargo market as a supplement
   instrument to generate additional revenue, thus making the airports more
   profitable and attractive.},

Abstract = {At the end of 2018, the European Parliament and Council adopted
   Directive (EU) 2019/1, often referred to as the `ECN+ Directive', which,
   among other things, contains provisions ensuring the independence of the
   competition authorities of the EU Member States (national competition
   authorities or NCAs), which are, together with the European Commission,
   responsible for the enforcement of the EU antitrust rules laid down in
   Articles 101 and 102 TFEU. In early 2019, the European Commission
   visibly showed its own independence by prohibiting Siemens' takeover of
   Alstom's rail transport business, a proposed merger publicly backed by
   the German and French governments. This article gives an overview of the
   independence guarantees in EU law and discusses more in general the
   notion of independence of competition authorities and its rationale.},

Abstract = {Horizontal price agreements can fall within the scope of exemptions to
   antitrust competition if they are expected to create pro-consumer
   benefits. Inspired by such horizontal agreements, we introduce a
   cooperative game in which a set of transport operators can collectively
   decide at what price to offer sustainable urban mobility services to a
   pool of travelers. The travelers choose amongst the mobility services
   according to a multinomial logit model, and the operators aim at
   maximizing their joint profit under a constant market share constraint.
   After showing that various well-known allocation rules (i.e.,
   proportional rules and the Shapley value) do not always generate core
   allocations, we present a core-guaranteeing allocation rule, the market
   share exchange rule. This rule first allocates to each transport
   operator the profit he or she generates under collaboration, and then
   subsequently compensates those transport operators that lose part of
   their market share, which is paid by the ones that receive some extra
   market share. This exchange of market share is facilitated by a unique
   price, which can be expressed as the additional return by cooperating
   per unit of market share. Finally, we show that, under some natural
   conditions, the market share exchange rule still sustains the
   collaboration when the transport operators need to pay back part of the
   joint profit to society. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Slovak competition policy is built on the pillars of the EU legal
   framework. It is designed to address issues related to the elimination
   agreements restricting competition and abuse of dominant market
   position, the control of company fusions, liberalization of monopoly
   economic sectors and state aid monitoring. Application of those rules
   are becoming increasingly concerns the postal and logistics services
   after the completed liberalization process. On the one hand, the postal
   sector is characterized by the existence of a highly competitive
   environment, particularly through the development of e-commerce. On the
   other hand, there still exists an obligation to ensure the availability
   of postal services that are regulated by the government. Many practical
   examples (from other sectors) indicate the tendency of enterprises to
   create conditions and scope for abuse of its market dominance. The role
   of regulatory authority starts here to control market concentration and
   to assess effective competition.
   The paper deals with the diagnostics of the competitive environment in
   the postal and logistics sector by applying quantitative methods and
   procedures for analysing the market concentrations and entry barriers.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of airline alliances on traffic of the
   constituent airlines using an analysis of US Bureau of Transportation
   Statistics T-100 International Market Data on a monthly basis for five
   routes to the US from European hubs. The European hubs are Frankfurt and
   Paris. The period covered is January 1990-December 2003; a sufficiently
   lengthy period to enable the derivation of good time-series models
   before the `intervention' of alliance formation and development. The
   alliances focussed on are Air France and Delta, part of the SkyTeam
   Alliance and Lufthansa and United Airlines, part of the Star Alliance.
   It is possible to distinguish code sharing agreements and then the
   subsequent immunity from US antitrust legislation. It is also possible
   to suggest some conclusions on the differences in alliance development
   in the more liberal open skies environments adopted by many European
   countries with the more traditional, stricter regulated bilaterals that
   exist in others such as the UK. Competition is examined using the
   Hirschman-Herfindahl Index so as to throw light on the impact of
   alliances on market concentration by route. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Today competitiveness among airline market companies getting increased.
   Companies pursue different strategies in order to cope with this
   intensive competition. Many of them adapt well-known business
   strategies: cost leadership, differentiation focused low-cost and
   differentiation into their business strategies. In airline market,
   especially Low-Cost Carriers (LCC) getting a strong challenge for
   traditional Full Service Network Carriers (FSNC) in competition.
   This paper provides a competition assessment of the Turkey domestic
   airline industry. According to this purpose we analyzed competition in
   Turkish air transport market between FSNC and LCC. In it we reach
   conclusions about the sector's performance and the level of competition,
   identify impediments to competition that policymakers can address and
   remove, and make specific competition policy recommendations to improve
   competition in the sector. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Market Structure of Urban Waste Treatment and Disposal: Empirical
   Evidence from the Italian Industry},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In light of the organizational dynamics of services of economic
   interest, the regulation of municipal solid waste management is a
   critical issue to deal with so as to achieve sustainability goals in the
   coming decades. The European circular economy targets limit the share of
   municipal waste in landfills to a maximum of 10\% by 2035. Consequently,
   waste-to-energy plants may temporarily become the primary option for
   residual unsorted waste. The municipal waste management chain comprises
   two consequential stages: collection and transport, and the treatment
   and disposal stage, which characterizes as an oligopolistic market
   structure. After defining the relevant market and calculating market
   concentration measures, we analyze market power in the treatment and
   disposal of non-recyclable mixed waste, also known as residual waste.
   Our analyses are based on empirical data using well-known market
   concentration indices such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman index and
   concentration ratios. We report the results of three different market
   concentration scenarios based on alternative geographic and product
   market definitions. Considering only waste-to-energy as a product
   market, we present a situation of moderate concentration, typically
   involving the attention of competition authorities. On the contrary,
   considering both options as a single product market, no relevant
   evidence emerges due to the significant share of waste sent to landfills
   in 2019, i.e., 20.1\% of the total municipal solid waste generated in
   Italy. Implications for future studies consist of new detailed
   information on the municipal waste treatment market structure in one of
   the leading European countries that may prompt comparative studies.
   Policy implications are derived from the possibility of taking cues from
   this paper to envisage appropriate regulatory models for an evolving
   sector in which market spaces are increasing.},

Title = {Liberalisation of airport air traffic control: A case study of Spain},
Journal = {TRANSPORT POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {38-47},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Liberalisation of air traffic management (ATM) through tendering of
   airport air traffic control services has occurred in selective
   countries. While there have been a few studies which have analysed the
   theoretical concepts of competition to provide ATM services, there has
   been limited evaluation of the experience of liberalisation on an
   individual country basis. Using secondary data from literature and
   primary data collected from interviews, this research reviews the
   experience of introducing competition in airport ATC services, using the
   experience in Spain as a case study. The study investigates barriers
   that hinder the development of an effectively competitive market
   structure and pro-competition policies to reduce them. The study finds
   that introducing competition in airport air traffic control is a complex
   process. In Spain, efficiency benefits have been achieved without
   compromising safety and economic regulation of the larger liberalised
   airports has been avoided. Access to qualified air traffic controllers
   is a critical barrier to the introduction of competition in airport air
   traffic control services in part related to the complex licence
   conditions which are unique to specific airports and functions.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Mandatory rules exist in contracts for international liner shipping
   primarily because of imbalances and non-equity in the allocation of
   contract responsibilities. The superior bargaining position owned by the
   carriers depends largely upon liner market monopoly levels, the supply
   and demand balance between the shipper and carrier, and the cargo volume
   size of the shippers. With the development of shipping technologies,
   mode of transport, and shipping competition policy, the unequal
   comparison of bargaining forces between shippers and carriers changes.
   When the existing mandatory rule was deemed no longer necessary due to
   changing circumstances, legislation requirements to restore freedom to
   contract became apparent. When both sides have equal bargaining power,
   adoption of the principle of freedom of contract for their business
   relationships is suitable. The Rotterdam Rules concerning freedom of
   volume contract construction is based on equal bargaining powers between
   both sides and responds to the evolving situation of the industry. The
   Rules represent the development trend of today's theory of contracts for
   international liner shipping and the demand for legal and institutional
   changes.},

Title = {The effectiveness of EC policies to move freight from road to rail:
   Evidence from CEE grain markets},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The European Commission adopted in 1991 a policy of encouraging the
   substitution of motor carrier haulage of freight with rail and water
   carrier haulage, as part of its ``green{''} agenda of reducing fuel
   consumption, emission of pollutants, carbon intensity, and road
   congestion. Regarding railway freight in particular, one policy tool
   that the Commission has emphasized for this purpose is the restructuring
   of the rail sectors of member countries through the creation of
   competition for the incumbents by new train-operating companies (TOC's)
   - seemingly a less obvious policy choice than alternatives such as
   Pigouvian taxation measures or infrastructure subsidies. This paper
   focuses on one important commodity group - grain - in three EC member
   states and one non-member state - Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
   and Ukraine - to examine what appear to be the binding constraints to
   increases in rail's share. Such constraints seem more closely related to
   shortages in infrastructure capacity than to a lack of competition among
   TOC's. Our findings suggest that a policy focused more directly on
   infrastructure investment - whether an increase in subsidies or
   alternative strategies for attracting private investment into
   infrastructure, including alternative reform models - will be required
   if the current constraints binding rail's share are to be relaxed.},

Abstract = {Air carriers operate, almost by definition, in an international
   environment. Under air services agreements (ASAs) concluded by European
   Union (EU) Member States with third countries, with or without the
   involvement of European institutions, many non-EU airlines offer flights
   to or from the Union. However, the correlative increase in competition
   has not only positive effects, e.g., a wider offer and more advantageous
   flight rates. The fact that the obligations imposed on - and, in
   general, the conditions applicable to - non-European carriers in their
   respective countries of origin are different from those that weigh on
   European airlines leads to situations in which EU and non-EU carriers do
   not compete on equivalent terms. Furthermore, anticompetitive behaviour
   on the part of the airlines cannot be ruled out. The question then is
   whether and to which extent European legislation is applicable to non-EU
   carriers, both in terms of competition law and sector-specific
   regulations. The present article aims at reviewing the current state of
   `extraterritorial' application of European law, mainly from an antitrust
   perspective, and it does so on the basis of a thorough analysis of a
   case currently pending before the General Court (GC), where the
   jurisdiction of the Commission has been challenged precisely for
   sanctioning non-EU carriers for acts performed outside the Common
   Market.},

Abstract = {Our focus is the evolution of business strategies and network structure
   decisions in the commercial passenger aviation industry. The paper
   reviews the growth of hub-and-spoke networks as the dominant business
   model following deregulation in the latter part of the 20th century,
   followed by the emergence of value-based airlines as a global phenomenon
   at the end of the century. The paper highlights the link between airline
   business strategies and network structures, and examines the resulting
   competition between divergent network structure business models. In this
   context we discuss issues of market structure stability and the role

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the cost efficiency of UK airports over the period
   1998-2008, using a Bayesian dynamic frontier model. This model provides
   a more structural explanation for the variation in airports inefficiency
   than has been presented by previous models, and also allows for cost
   inefficiency effects. On average, the dynamic frontier results,
   estimated via the Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulation, indicate that UK
   airports improved their efficiency over time. Factors found to be
   important determinants of cost efficiency include airport size, price
   regulation, price cap variations and airport competition. Policy
   implications of the results are derived. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations recently
   adopted a Multilateral Agreement on Air Services that seeks to
   liberalize market access and ownership and control requirements for air
   carriers in the region. The Agreement is a precursor to an eventual
   Single Aviation Market arrangement targeted for 2015. This article
   analyzes the key provisions of the Agreement and identifies the factors
   that will likely impact on the future SAM. In particular, there is
   uncertainty as to whether the SAM will go beyond third, fourth and fifth
   freedom relaxations to include important seventh freedom rights as well
   as more permissive ownership and control structures for air carriers.
   There are also lingering concerns over the loss of state sovereignty
   impacting on attempts to harmonize safety and technical standards,
   aviation security and competition policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {A ticket to ride: Evolving landscapes of air travel accessibility in the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY},

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {During the past decade, air passenger service in the United States has
   been exposed to numerous carrier bankruptcies, antitrust investigations,
   mergers, labor problems and a massive increase in competition. These
   internal elements, combined with the rising costs of fuel and the threat
   of terrorism combine to make a relatively uncertain air travel landscape
   for both passengers and operators. Moreover, these dynamics have
   generated significant geographical shifts in airline route structures
   and airports serviced by commercial carriers. These factors, combined
   with increasing levels of consumer access to fare and routing
   information, have altered the landscape of air travel accessibility in
   the United States. The purpose of this paper is to examine issues of
   consumer air travel accessibility through all analysis of three critical
   measures: flight segments, flight time and ticket costs. In addition, a
   typology of air passenger accessibility is generated for the 156 busiest
   commercial airports in the United States using these three measures.
   Results suggest significant local and regional biases in time and cost,
   relative to distance, for many US markets. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Cooperation in the ocean liner shipping industry has always been
   important to improve liner shipping networks (LSN's). As tight
   cooperations like alliances are challenged by antitrust laws, looser
   forms of cooperation among liner carriers might become a reasonable way
   to increase efficiency of LSN's. Our goal is to facilitate a loose form
   of cooperation among liner carriers. Therefore, we introduce a
   coordination mechanism for designing a collaborative LSN based on a
   multi round combinatorial auction. Via the auction, carriers exchange
   demand triplets, i.e. orders which describe the transport of containers
   between ports. A standard network design problem which includes ship
   scheduling and cargo routing decisions is used as isolated network
   design problem of an individual carrier. A carrier has to solve this
   isolated problem repeatedly during the auction so that the carrier is
   able to decide which demand triplets to sell, on which demand triplets
   to bid, and what prices to charge. To solve these problems we propose a
   variable neighborhood search based matheuristic. The matheuristic
   addresses the isolated planning problem in four phases (construct ship
   cycles, modify cycles, determine container flow, and reallocate ships to
   cycles). Our computational experiments on a set of 56 synthetic test
   instances suggest that the introduced combinatorial auction increases
   profits on average compared to isolated planning significantly by 4\%.
   The more diverse the original assignment of demand triplets and ships to
   carriers is, the higher the potential for collaboration; for 18 diverse
   instances, the profits increase on average by 10\%.},

Abstract = {The deregulation of aviation in the United States and intercity bus
   transport in the United Kingdom initially resulted in substantial fare
   reductions associated with new market entry.  Many new market entrants
   subsequently left the market and fares increased.  International
   aviation in Europe has been operated by national airlines with price
   collusion and capacity sharing and a ban on new entrants.  The normal
   economy fares charged on air services within Europe are the highest in
   the world.  Therefore, there is significant scope for fare reductions
   when the European Community (EC) internal market comes into operation in
   1993.  Deregulation of market access will, however, leave unaddressed
   other barriers to contestability in the deregulated European aviation
   market.  The structural barriers to contestability include hub airport
   dominance by the incumbent airlines, ground handling monopolies, and
   computer reservation system (CRS) bias.  The paper proposes measures to
   ensure access to major airports for new entrant airlines on equal terms
   with incumbent airlines and the deregulation of the market for airport
   ground handling.  The EC code of conduct for the neutral operation of
   CRS for incumbent and new entrant carriers is an important precedent. 
   The strategic obstacles to contestability in a deregulated European
   airline industry are anticompetitive mergers and predatory pricing.  In
   recent years national airlines have acquired several independent
   airlines in important European markets.  It is recommended that such
   takeovers be prohibited because of their anticompetitive implications in
   the absence of competition between national airlines.  The large
   networks of national airlines allow them to pursue policies of
   geographical price discrimination with reduced fares on contested routes
   and higher fares on uncontested routes.  Price surveillance is
   recommended to explain fare differences between contested and
   uncontested routes.  It is recommended that the EC competition policy
   exemption for price consultations between airlines be ended.  Without
   measures to tackle the structural and strategic obstacles to competition
   in European aviation, its liberalization may have no impact on the
   present high-cost system.},

Journal = {TRANSPORT POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {174-181},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The impact of COVID-19 on air transport is unprecedented and some
   well-known airline brands may disappear as a result. Governments around
   the world have responded swiftly to cushion the financial impact by
   offering direct wage subsidies, tax relief, loans, etc. This paper
   explores the government's appropriate responses to failing airlines'
   bailout request by examining the case of Virgin Australia. Following the
   bailout policy principles established in the literature, we suggest that
   bankruptcy protection should be considered as the first solution to a
   failing carrier. A bailout decision should be guided by a set of
   principles and procedures, which should not be taken lightly. Our
   analysis also shows that the government cannot take a hands-off approach
   in the absence of private lenders and investors, as the costs to
   consumers and regional residents would be huge if the carrier could not
   get through the COVID-19 pandemic. A minimum level of assistance with
   conditions might be needed to maintain market competition.},

Title = {Is There Still a Southwest Effect?},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2013},
Number = {2325},
Pages = {1-8},
Abstract = {The U.S. airline industry is in a period of consolidation through
   mergers between leading carriers. A number of recent mergers have been
   approved by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ),
   in part because of the presence of Southwest Airlines in the affected
   markets. In its approval of the mergers, DOJ makes a key assumption that
   Southwest is unresponsive in its pricing strategy to the reduced
   competition when its competitors merge. Numerous studies have validated
   the so-called Southwest effect, through which potential or actual entry
   into a market by Southwest Airlines is associated with lower market
   fares. However, considerably less work has examined Southwest's
   postentry pricing strategies. This study finds that Southwest raised
   fares more between 2005 and 2010 in markets affected by the Delta
   Northwest and US Airways America West mergers than in other markets.
   Southwest's fares either decreased or rose by less when the company was
   facing direct or adjacent competition from a low-cost carrier (LCC).
   DOJ's approval of Southwest's merger with AirTran, its biggest LCC
   competitor and strongest deterrent to raising fares in merger-affected
   markets, raises questions about Southwest's ability to continue as a
   suitable deterrent to postmerger fare hikes, particularly in the absence
   of other LCCs in those markets.},

Abstract = {The air transport industry has remained one of the most regulated and
   restrictive industries in international trade. Domestic deregulation and
   liberalization have been progressing at an uneven pace across countries,
   and liberalization of the international markets has yet to overcome
   numerous obstacles. Air carriers, on the other hand, need to build up an
   extensive global network to realize economics of scope and density and
   to meet consumer demands. To accomplish this, they need to have foreign
   partners. However, ownership restrictions do not allow for cross-country
   mergers or takeovers. As a result, alliances have become, and will
   remain in the near future, the primary means for expanding and
   strengthening airline global service networks. Alliances have provided a
   way for carriers to mitigate the limitations of bilateral agreements,
   ownership restrictions, and licensing and control regulations. In
   effect, both airlines and governments consider international alliances
   to be the second best solution to achieve free trade in world aviation.
   This paper discusses regulatory issues related to international airline
   alliances. Section 1 provides an overview of the current regulations
   surrounding alliance frameworks, and Section 2 contains a synthesis of
   economic analysis of regulatory concerns for international airline
   alliances. Section 3 discusses international coordination in regulations
   of airline alliances, and Section 4 provides a summary and conclusion.

Title = {Why Does Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 Provide for the Imposition of
   Penalties Only on Undertakings?: A Historical Perspective},
Journal = {WORLD COMPETITION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {195-235},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {According to Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, the
   Commission may impose any fines for the breach of substantive
   competition rules only on `undertakings'. The provision does not
   contemplate the imposition of fines on individuals considered
   responsible for the conduct of the undertaking concerned, even though,
   as explained in this article, this position is not imposed by the
   relevant legal basis (Article 83 EC {[}the Treaty establishing the
   European Community in the version following the Treaty of Amsterdam],
   corresponding to Article 87 EEC Treaty {[}the Treaty establishing the
   European Economic Community in its version of 1957] and the present
   Article 103 TFEU {[}the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
   Union]) That legal basis would indeed allow such liability to be
   established. From a policy point of view, however, it is often argued
   that sanctions should also be imposed on such individuals. This raises
   the question as to why the Union legislator chose not to provide for
   corresponding powers on the Commission's part. From the relevant
   legislative history exposed in this article, it emerges that the
   approach of Article 23(2)(a) ultimately originates from the ECSC Treaty
   {[}theTreaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community]. In
   this latter context, it reflected the particular limits placed by its
   authors on that Treaty. It did not reflect the contemporary orientations
   at national level regarding punitive sanctions. The approach gradually
   found its way into Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 without any further
   specific discussion on the way, despite the different context offered by
   the relevant provisions of the EEC/EC Treaty. It was first transplanted
   into Regulation No 11, based on Article 79 EEC Treaty (today Article 95
   TFEU) and concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates
   and conditions. The negotiations preceding the adoption of this
   Regulation brought to light strong reserves regarding the conferral of
   sanctioning powers upon the (then) EEC, and it was no doubt unrealistic
   to expect that it would have been granted powers more far-reaching than
   those available under the ECSC Treaty. When Regulation No 17 (and
   specifically Article 15) was elaborated, the drafters were aware of the
   scheme established by Regulation No 11, which served as a reference. No
   genuine discussion regarding possible powers to punish the persons
   considered responsible for the conduct of the `undertaking' took place.
   If is likely that any such innovation would not have been realistic at
   that point. Lastly, the reform brought about by Regulation (EC) No
   1/2003 focused on other aspects regarding the implementation of
   competition law, and the scheme of Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17 has
   been taken over into Article 23(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2013 without
   major changes. No consideration was given to the possible imposition o
   penalties on natural persons implicated in the commission of breaches of
   competition law.},

Abstract = {Globalization of the world economy has redefined completely the way
   national economics work, including the channels through which
   competition operates. Before globalization, a domestic producer that
   produced for the domestic market usually competed directly only with
   other domestic producers. Competition with producers located in other
   countries was a matter of concern only for a few producers explicitly
   involved in trade across national frontiers. Now, most producers of
   internationally tradable goods find that even when producing for the
   local market, they have to compete with products coming to that local
   market from all over the world. In many respects, the economic impact of
   producing for the domestic market or for exporting is in both cases the
   same, even for the balance of trade. One dollar more of exports is the
   same as one dollar more sold in the domestic markets, which given an
   open economy and assuming perfectly tradable goods, displaces exactly
   one dollar of imports, with the same impact on the trade balance and,
   assuming away policy induced distortions, on general domestic prosperity
   (at least in gross terms).
   For this reason, some people have argued that competition policy has
   become less relevant in the modern world, to the extent that the
   geographical extension of the markets, and therefore the number of
   competitors and the degree of competition, increase with globalization.
   However, this assertion is wrong, both on theoretical and on empirical
   grounds. About half the production and consumption in almost any present
   day economy is accounted for by goods that are not internationally
   tradable, due to high transportation costs, barriers to international
   trade, or other barriers to entry to the domestic markets, other than
   overt protectionism. Among these goods there are many personal services
   and housing, and several telecommunication services (the famous and
   usually contentious last mile), to name a few. Even the typical
   tradable, and traded, good has an important component of its value added
   that is not internationally tradable, such as the domestic components of
   transport, distribution and retailing margins.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the economic effects of deregulation in
   Japan's intercity coach industry. Specifically, we examine the intensity
   of competition in the industry using a unique dataset, to evaluate the
   economic effects of two major deregulations in 2002 and 2013. The
   absence of organized data means there is no previous research that
   quantitatively evaluates the deregulations. We collect data capturing
   the entry of bus operating companies by web-scraping and use a
   structural estimation method developed in econometrics for the purpose
   of measuring the degree of competition. Our em-pirical analysis yields
   the following three main results. First, we find that the markup ratios
   always exceed 1, which indicates that the entry of one additional firm
   always intensifies competition. Specifically, the markup gained by one
   firm under duopoly is estimated to be about three quarters of that under
   monopoly. Second, the competitive effect of an additional entry
   decreases as the number of incumbents increases. This result is obtained
   irrespective of the mode of competition. Third, we find that the
   services offered by firms in the industry are significantly
   differentiated. Counterfactual analysis reveals that additional 0.76
   firms can enter a market on average by differentiating their products
   from each other. These results provide useful insights into the
   development of competition policy pertaining to the contemporary
   transportation industry.},

Abstract = {At the THREDBO 12 Durban Conference in 2011, in a paper entitled ``The
   Case for Intercity Bus Deregulation in Germany{''} (Knorr, Eisenkopf,
   Arndt and Burgdorf, 2011), we presented our ex ante assessment of the
   potential effects of intercity bus deregulation in Germany. This
   deregulation finally took effect January 1st, 2013. Our analysis led us
   to expect that substantial economic benefits were likely to accrue to
   the travelling public and society as a whole. In particular, we assumed
   that (potential) passengers especially those from lower income brackets
   would stand to gain massively from lower prices and a larger variety of
   travel options due to overlapping competing networks, at least on trunk
   routes (of which substantially more exist in Germany than in the UK, the
   USA or Sweden, given the country's polycentric economic geography, its
   high population density and very even spatial distribution of the
   population). Further, we expected that these economic benefits would not
   be limited to intercity bus travellers, as we also held that the
   imminent liberalization should force Deutsche Bahn AG to lower prices
   for their rail services and to improve the quality of its competing
   offerings. Last but not least, we stressed the crucial role of
   competition policy for these economic benefits to fully materialize. Our
   main concern then was that incumbent Deutsche Bahn AG might attempt to
   abuse the massive pre-liberalization dominance it had held on the
   regulated intercity bus market, in combination with its nearly intact de
   facto monopoly on long-distance railroad services, to stifle the genesis
   of this new market in its early stages with the aim to undermine the
   rise of potent intra- and intermodal competitors. In this paper for
   THREDBO 14, we contrast our 2011 projections with the observable intra-
   and intermodal effects in the two years since the German intercity bus
   market has been liberalized. In addition, we provide an overview of the
   corporate strategies of the new intercity bus operators and the
   strategic adjustments implemented by Deutsche Bahn AG. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {European Union Competition Law Developments in the Aviation Sector:
   January to June 2019},
Journal = {AIR \& SPACE LAW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {44},
Number = {6},
Pages = {499-518},
Abstract = {The first half of 2019 has been dominated by the significant number of
   mergers being decided with no less than 6/7 mergers having been approved
   by the European Commission ('Commission') in the six-month period.
   Interestingly, the commitments offered in three previous merger cases
   have been revisited, and while it would appear novel that the Commission
   released Air France Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. ( KLM) from
   the commitment on one long-haul city pair, the Commission noting that
   parallel commitments given in the transatlantic joint venture (JV)
   antitrust case would enable the Commission to review the functioning of
   the market in the period 2020-2025. The other merger case worth noting
   is the CityJet/Aer Lingus wet lease arrangement. It was looked at from a
   merger perspective and where with the UK's Competition and Markets
   Authority ('CMA') considering the `exiting firm' strategy and it cleared
   the transaction on that basis.
   The adoption and entry into force of Regulation 2019/712 on safeguarding
   competition in the air transport sector is potentially also a milestone.
   Whether this will be used by EU air carriers and/or the Commission
   remains to be seen.
   Litigation also features heavily in the first half of 2019, with Ryanair
   being on the successful side twice (being successful in the appeal of a
   Commission decision, but also successfully supported the Commission in
   defending its decision against an appeal of a Commission decision
   brought by Lufthansa. Of particular note for private damages actions is
   the UK litigation involving British Airways before the Court of Appeal
   where the air cargo cartel damages claimant was unsuccessful at widening
   the scope of its damages claim to include the period from 2001 to 30
   April 2004 (a period not covered by the Commission's decision but where
   there was arguably evidence of cartel behaviour) because the Court of
   Appeal did not have jurisdiction to hear a claim unless and until the
   Commission or a national competition authority had taken a decision.
   The dearth of new State aid investigations in the aviation sector might
   be the result of the Commission's modernisation regime having a positive
   effect. We will wait and see if this trend continues.},

Abstract = {Market definition and structure are central to the decision calculus of
   competition policy in Australia and other countries. The decision to
   allow firms to acquire the assets of another firm or to merge ownership
   often rests on how the acquisition or merger will change market
   structure and in turn may generate market power. In retailing, the
   spatial characteristics of markets are highly important.
   A geographic market can be viewed analogously to a physical catchment -
   defined by a resident population and transport infrastructure.
   Unfortunately the tools generally used to define geographic market
   structure are quite primitive, for example, the number of competitors
   within a specified radius of a store location. Clearly such measures are
   biased by differences in population density and transport infrastructure
   and patterns. Bias corrections such as travel times are possible but
   complex.
   An alternative approach is use the location of competitors, existing and
   under a proposed acquisition or merger, to define geographic markets.
   The definitions that are explored in this paper are based on the
   Delaunay tessellation and the construction of Voronoi polygons. These
   techniques are used to optimally locate network and public
   infrastructure and can be used to construct what is a relatively natural
   definition of market structure from a supplier's, as opposed to a
   consumer's, perspective. These measures include, for example:
   A franchise or chain catchment - that is, the area surrounding an
   individual store in which it is the closest outlet belonging to a
   particular franchise or chain. For example, amongst all Coles
   supermarkets, there is an area in which one particular Coles supermarket
   is the closest.
   A geographic market share - that is, the proportion of the population
   that is closest to a particular chain.
   Geographic diversity - a measure of the extent to which a geographic
   area is serviced by stores of one or more chains.
   Voronoi polygons are also useful for exploring the impacts of site
   acquisition or mergers through counterfactual simulation. Site
   acquisition is particularly well suited as the vertices of the Voronoi
   polygons are natural candidate locations.
   Measures were constructed for supermarkets in South East Queensland. The
   results suggest that retail competition is intense. There is a high
   level of geographic diversity considerably more than would be expected
   if store locations were randomly distributed in terms of ownership
   structure. Existing competitors would find it difficult to acquire or
   situate new assets in a way that would give them localised market power.
   Smaller chains can have a competitive advantage in that they are not
   often forced to compete with their own stores when establishing new
   sites. Larger chains are likely to need to consider sites that will
   limit losses as opposed to maximise gains in market share.},

Abstract = {The major air transport markets at the early part of the 21st century
   are failing to generate sufficient revenues to cover their long-run
   costs. Many airline are being supported by subsidies, going out of
   business (e.g. Sabena, Ansett, Canadian International, Swissair) or
   having to resort to various forms of financial restructuring such as
   afforded by Chapter I I bankruptcy laws in the US (US Airways, Midway,
   National). The effects of the terrorist attacks of September 2001 have
   exacerbated this situation, but the data suggests the problem be more
   deep routed in the `deregulated' markets that now exist in many parts of
   the world. This paper concerns itself with the issue of whether there
   are intrinsic features of the scheduled network airline industry that
   makes the current structure of liberalized markets unsustainable. It
   highlights on a number of features of this market but pays particular
   attention to the question of whether the market is naturally prone to
   excesses in competition that, because of its nature, forces airline
   fares down to the level where full costs cannot be recovered. It focuses
   in this sense on a long established concept in economics, namely does a
   core exist in this market. The fact that there is prima face evidence to
   suggest that the core is empty then leads to a discussion of appropriate
   policy reactions that may allow a more sustainable market structure to
   survive. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Protectionist tendencies of EU Member States have always been evident in
   sectors of industry that previously were dominated largely by
   state-owned companies, namely, the banking, defense, energy, postal,
   telecommunications, transport, and water sectors where, following
   privatization, Member States have sought to preserve or create so-called
   ``national champions.{''} However, a new wave of protectionism or
   economic patriotism by Member States has broken out recently, as
   exemplified by the long-running saga of the takeover of Endesa, the
   Spanish electricity group. This article examines the compatibility of
   special rights and other state measures with the EC's single market
   objectives within the framework of the EC Treaty and their impact on
   foreign takeovers and investments. It also examines the initiatives
   taken by the Commission in order to eliminate such measures and analyzes
   the potential remedies available to foreign investors when confronted
   with such measures. Such remedies include the application of the
   Commission's powers under Article 21 of the EC Merger Regulation that
   arguably could be used to even greater effect with the abolition or
   curtailment of the two-thirds rule.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine resale price maintenance (RPM) in a classic
   model of downstream retailers engaging in spatial price discrimination.
   We show that a resale price floor increases the total profit of the
   upstream monopoly when transport cost (product differentiation) is
   relatively low. Importantly, this profitable RPM floor can also enhance
   social welfare and even consumer surplus. A resale price ceiling can
   also be profitable and always improves consumer surplus and social
   welfare. We argue that such findings support a rule of reason approach
   to RPM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper empirically investigates price reactions to the entry of the
   low-cost carrier Gol Airlines in the Brazilian domestic market in 2001.
   Given the substantial reduction in unconditional yields of the incumbent
   airlines on routes actually entered by Gol, we perform an econometric
   analysis of the determinants of pricing power along with the analysis of
   the pattern of price reactions by incumbent legacy carriers. Using data
   from a panel of routes disaggregated at the airline level, we obtain
   that (i) both airport and route presence are relevant at explaining
   pricing behavior; (ii) price responses vary significantly according to
   flight distance and the amount of seats supplied by the entrant, in the
   sense that the shorter the route, and the more the seats offered by the
   newcomer, the stronger the price reactions from the incumbents, with
   significant point estimates in the range 22-26\% in yield reduction for
   routes as short its 350 km (approx. 195 miles). More generally, the
   results shed light on the impacts of airline deregulation in emerging
   markets and the issue of localized competitive advantage due to product
   differentiation in the industry. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {At the core of airline foreign investment restrictions: A study of 121
   countries},
Journal = {TRANSPORT POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {234-251},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is a growing discrepancy between the success of economic
   liberalization in international air services and the remaining limits to
   trans-border airline investment, especially the constraints embedded in
   national airline establishment regimes. The discussion on this problem
   should be backed with adequate legal research concerning the actual
   state of regulations and government actions regarding airline
   investment. The aim of this article is, therefore, to deliver practical
   information on these limitations worldwide, along with careful
   annotations. The paper portrays the world-wide scale and extent of the
   discussed restrictions by presenting regulations on airline ownership
   and control in 121 states and territories. Normative characteristics of
   the airline nationality requirements are discussed based on the above
   material, key rulings and literature. This includes an analysis of legal
   construction of the limitations, their sources and addressees, relations
   of the ownership and control tests and the role of discretionary
   regulatory policy. The study shows that airline investment rules
   worldwide generally remain restrictive and that the potential for reform
   is outside the ownership and control-based system rather than within it.

Abstract = {This paper examines the possibilities for improving the performance and
   increasing the capacity of China's railroad system through the
   introduction of competition. Countries throughout the world are in the
   process of abandoning the centralised, monopoly, state-owned model of
   the railway in favour of models that create competition. Different
   competitive models have been proposed and are being tried. This paper
   discusses the reform experience with the two basic models and their
   variations, focusing especially on some of the operational and
   regulatory challenges that vertical separation is understood to impose.
   It seeks to apply the lessons of the experience to date to the situation
   in China.},

Abstract = {This paper documents some stylized facts about domestic codesharing
   practices in the US airline industry. It is demonstrated that unlike
   international codesharing, the majority of domestic codeshare tickets do
   not combine the networks of two carriers. Rather, most codeshare tickets
   between major US carriers are virtual in nature, whereby one carrier
   sells tickets on flights operated entirely by another carrier. Moreover,
   we show that the price of these virtual tickets are, on average, less
   than those operated and marketed by a single carrier. (c) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {The Chinese freight railways system has been under capacity pressure and
   apparently acting as a constraint on continued economic growth for
   several years now. Earlier government consideration of serious
   structural reforms has given way to an emphasis on a dramatic expansion
   of the track network, most conspicuously by construction of high-speed
   passenger lines to free capacity for freight trains. A good deal of
   uncertainty remains as to both whether there will be sufficient track
   capacity to handle the increased volumes of coal and containers
   necessary for continued growth, and whether the desired private
   investment funds will be forthcoming so long as the system remains under
   tight government control. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Effective regulation and regulators are crucial in the global market
   economy setting. The article is dedicated to the issue of independent
   regulators and requirements for their efficient functioning. We explain
   several dimensions of the term independence such as functional and
   political independence, de jure and de facto independence. De jure and
   de facto independence are not necessarily identical, because a country
   may have a formal legislative framework effectively set but this does
   not necessarily translate into the real decision- making of the
   regulator. Based on the knowledge gathered from research work in this
   field and our own research, we try to identify relevant parameters of
   the de political and functional independence of the Slovak competition
   authority. Afterwards, these parameters are compared with a similar
   regulatory institution abroad (UK). On the basis of the analysis and
   comparison we indicate possibilities for improvements. We propose to
   introduce an open selection procedure for the post of the Chairman and
   Vice-Chairman of the Anti-Monopoly Office and to cancel the possibility
   to renew the mandate. We propose amending the monocratic first instance
   decision-making system to a collective system. In the second-instance
   proceedings decisions are taken by the Council, but it is necessary to
   change the method of board members selection. Next, we propose launching
   of a notification system of management and decision makers meetings with
   politicians, businessmen in particular if those are in proceedings
   before the Office. In addition to the issue of independence, it is
   important to pay attention also to the accountability of the regulator.},

Abstract = {Scheduling coordination is considered both a reason for and a
   consequence of airline consolidation. The authors formally model this
   dimension of airline partnerships, with complementary alliance where
   stop-over delays affect passengers' utility. They compare partnership
   where carriers are only allowed to coordinate scheduling to the one,
   where airlines can jointly set prices and schedules. Coordination in
   fares and schedules yields lower fares and better scheduling
   coordination. Coordination in only the price results in lower consumer
   welfare than under no coordination. The authors suggest an example of a
   complementary airline alliance hurting interline passengers.},

Title = {Competitive Effects of Joint Ventures in the International Airline
   Industry},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2676},
Number = {2},
Pages = {59-68},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the past two decades, many international airline carriers have
   expanded their cooperation by forming various joint ventures (JVs). One
   key feature of these JVs is that they require carriers to determine
   certain airfares jointly and integrate their operations as a single
   carrier in the market for international air travel. This paper tries to
   evaluate the impact of JVs on airfares. The focus is on a set of
   behind-to-gateway markets between a non-gateway U.S. city and a foreign
   gateway city, where both online and codeshare flights are offered, to
   study how the airfares of online flights are affected after carriers
   form JVs. A new hypothesis is discussed that JVs increase the airfares
   of online flights. Based on this hypothesis, an empirical model is built
   to evaluate the Oneworld alliance's transatlantic JV established in July
   2010. This empirical analysis, which uses the U.S. Department of
   Transportation (U.S. DOT)'s Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B)
   international data from 2008 to 2013, indicates that the Oneworld
   transatlantic JV increased airfares of online flights by about 3\%-4\%
   in the behind-to-gateway markets. Previous studies, which emphasized the
   airfare reductions of codeshare flights in the connecting markets, may
   have overestimated the benefits to consumers from JVs. U.S. DOT can
   better protect consumers by evaluating plausible airfare increases in
   online flights in the behind-to-gateway markets when reviewing new
   applications for JVs.},

Abstract = {The United States has negotiated bilateral open skies agreements to
   deregulate airline competition on US international routes, but little is
   known about their effects on travelers' welfare and the gains from the
   US negotiating agreements with more countries. We develop a model of
   international airline competition to estimate the effects of open skies
   agreements on fares and flight frequency. We find the agreements have
   generated at least \$4 billion in annual gains to travelers and that
   travelers would gain an additional \$4 billion if the US negotiated
   agreements with other countries that have a significant amount of
   international passenger traffic.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the effects of a European airline merger followed by
   a consolidation of two competing international alliances. The exercise
   has been inspired by the Air France-KLM merger, which is expected to
   spur consolidation of the Northwest-KLM and SkyTeam alliances into a
   single mega-alliance. The results of the analysis show that, although
   the airlines benefit through higher profits, the merger and alliance
   consolidation harm consumers while reducing overall social surplus. The
   reason for this negative outcome is that, as modeled, all the effects of
   the merger and alliance consolidation are anticompetitive. (C) 2004

Abstract = {The railways of Russia and the Central and Eastern European countries
   are in the process of restructuring. In most cases, the ``vertical
   separation{''} reform model is being pursued, and reformers are seeking
   to introduce competition among freight train operators through the
   provision of ``open access{''} to the monopoly infrastructure. This
   paper shows that, in two countries, Poland and Romania, a good deal of
   competition has been created by the entry of new freight operators, many
   of them either large shippers integrating upstream or former freight
   forwarders. However, in other countries, the incumbent freight operators
   retain virtually 100 percent of the market. In particular, Russia has
   taken only the very first steps toward creating competition in this
   sector, and new freight train operators face significant barriers to
   competing with the incumbent.},

Abstract = {Open skies agreements have allowed for greater competition on North
   Atlantic routes, including entry by low-cost carriers. At the same time,
   airline alliances have formed cooperative arrangements that may mitigate
   competition. Data are gathered on North Atlantic routes and the impact
   of low-cost carrier and alliance competition is assessed. We find that
   the entry by the largest low-cost carrier, Norwegian, on a
   gateway-to-gateway route results in fare reductions of about 12 per
   cent. An additional alliance carrier, however, has no impact on
   gateway-to-gateway fares since the benefits from an additional
   competitor are offset by the dis-benefits from alliance cooperation.},

Abstract = {Railways restructuring takes place under very different circumstances
   and with very different goals in Western Europe, Central and Eastern
   Europe, and Russia. There are some improvements in productivity
   associated with the reforms in the European Union (among others access
   to infrastructure and vertical separation). But they are not certain to
   be replicated following similar restructuring in transition economies,
   especially if one takes account of the much higher shadow price on
   government subsidies in the latter. The current and proposed reforms in
   the railways of Central and Eastern Europe and Russia are described in
   detail; the likely outcomes of reforms in the special economic,
   regulatory and legal environments of these countries are analysed; and
   an alternative proposal for restructuring in Russia is presented.},

Title = {How do global airline alliances affect flight frequency? Evidence from
   Russia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {98},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects on flight frequency of two alliances
   that came about in the Russian airline market in recent years: between
   Aeroflot and SkyTeam in 2006, and between S7 and oneworld in 2010. We
   use a difference-in-differences (DID) model to identify the effects of
   these alliances on flight frequencies. The integration of S7 into
   oneworld provides evidence that the alliance resulted in reduced flight
   frequencies on routes where S7 overlapped with its new partners, but
   that it resulted in increased frequencies on routes where there was no
   overlap, especially in the case of so-called thin routes. Regarding the
   integration of Aeroflot into SkyTeam, we find that the alliance led to
   increased flight frequencies on routes where Aeroflot and its new
   partners had previously been competing. The fact that Aeroflot is a
   state-owned airline with a strong position in the Russian market might
   explain this expansion after the alliance. We also find that the
   alliance increased the frequencies on thin routes where there was no
   overlap.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the impact of strategic airline alliances on
   African aviation. Globally, there has been an ongoing trend towards
   airlines coordinating their activities via strategic alliances and joint
   ventures. These alliances affect market competition, including the
   quality and costs of services provided. Despite the economic benefits
   found in prior analyses of alliances in other markets, the study of
   alliance participation by African airlines is very limited. Our
   empirical analysis indicates that membership of one of the three global
   alliances could, by expanding their market presence, benefit African
   airlines. It would add to their passenger flows and enhance their
   economic efficiency.},

Abstract = {This study investigates congestion pricing and capacity investment for
   an international network linking two countries' airports and airlines.
   Under a Bertrand-Nash supposition for airports and Cournot competition
   for airlines in a duopoly, we characterize the locally optimal pricing
   rules for uniform and discriminatory charges levied by each country's
   airport. We clarify that the locally optimal pricing rules include a
   significant component resulting from the incentive to exploit the
   foreign airline, which is not included in the optimal pricing rules set
   by a social/global welfare-maximizing authority. We evaluate the pricing
   rules of the two airport charges for a round trip (i.e., the sum of each
   airport's per-departing passenger charge). We clarify that the incentive
   to exploit the foreign airline is, theoretically, the only source of
   deviation from global welfare maximization (which may reach the
   first-best outcome) regardless of the uniform or discriminatory charges'
   pricing regimes. Furthermore, we show that each airport's runway
   capacity investment could be globally efficient under globally optimal
   pricing rules, whereas each airport tends to overinvest under locally
   optimal pricing rules. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Hybrid cooperation agreements in networks: The case of the airline
   industry},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {194-227},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper develops a unified framework to analyze a continuum of hybrid
   cooperation agreements along two dimensions: their degree of revenue
   sharing (scope of alliances) and their degree of cost sharing (scope of
   joint ventures). The analysis focuses on the air transportation
   industry, distinguishing between interline and interhub markets. As
   economies of traffic density become stronger, we find that the socially
   optimal cooperation agreement moves from full alliance to joint venture
   in interline markets, whereas it moves from joint venture to merger in
   interhub markets. These results are driven by the tradeoff between a
   procompetitive effect of alliances in interline markets and an
   anticompetitive effect in interhub markets, along with the efficiency
   gains associated with joint ventures in interhub markets. We also
   develop an empirical application for intercontinental routes for the
   period 2010-2016 that identifies a positive impact of deeper degrees of
   airline cooperation (revenue and cost sharing) on traffic, both in
   interline and interhub markets. Therefore, the potential anticompetitive
   effect of deeper alliances in interhub markets is not observed in our
   sample. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Alliances and service quality in the airline industry},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {68},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper explores the effect of market structure on quality
   determination for complementary products. The focus is on the airline
   industry and the effect of airline alliances on flight frequency, an
   important element of service quality. With zero layover cost, the choice
   of flight frequencies has the same double-marginalization structure as
   in the usual alliance model, leading to a higher frequency in the
   alliance case as double marginalization is eliminated, along with a
   lower full trip price and higher traffic. The surprising result of the
   paper emerges with high-cost layover time, where double marginalization
   in frequencies is absent and where an alliance reduces service quality
   via a lower frequency, with the full price potentially rising (in which
   case traffic falls). (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We consider an empirical model of worldwide airline alliances that we
   apply to a large set of companies for the period 1995-2000. Using
   observations at the network level, we estimate a cost, capacity, and
   demand system that accounts for cross-price elasticities. Our
   contribution consists in evaluating airlines' strategical interactions
   through the window of firms' network interconnections. We consider
   networks coincidences and potential connections with all their rivals.
   The results allow us to classify all company pairs as either complements
   or substitutes. We shed light on the fact that many airlines involved in
   the same alliance are potential substitutes.},

   dual-channel chain with different content formats},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {We investigate a model in which a monopoly supplier distributes two
   types of its product, physical and electronic products, through a
   traditional/brick-and-mortar retailer with a wholesale price contract
   and an online retailer with an agency contract, respectively. The
   supplier and the online retailer negotiate the royalty rate, which is a
   ratio of the online retailer's revenue to the entire revenue of the
   channel. We also discuss the case in which the supplier imposes the
   following self-regulation to balance its dual-channel supply chain: the
   retail price of the online retailer is not lower than the wholesale
   price for the traditional retailer. What will happen if the supplier
   employs such self-regulation? Is self-regulation beneficial to the two
   retailers? To answer these questions, we first derive the equilibrium
   without such self-regulation. Second, we investigate what happens if the
   supplier employs such self-regulation. We obtain the following results.
   First, in the baseline model, an increase in the online retailer's
   bargaining power over the supplier benefits the two retailers but harms
   the supplier. Second, under self-regulation, the wholesale price is
   strictly higher than that in the baseline model. Third, the retailers'
   equilibrium prices are also strictly higher than those in the baseline
   model. Self-regulation always benefits the online retailer. It benefits
   the traditional retailer if the online retailer's bargaining power is
   sufficiently weak. Furthermore, self-regulation benefits the supplier if
   the substitutability between the two retailers is not high. However, it
   reduces consumer and social welfare.},
